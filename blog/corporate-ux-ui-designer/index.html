  <h1>What it&#39;s like to be a Corporate UX/UI Designer</h1>
  <p>2022-12-20</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/corporate-buildings.png" alt="img"></p>
<h3>Understanding Corporate Culture</h3>
<p>Before we talk about the role of a UX/UI Designer. It would be helpful to explain corporate culture.</p>
<p>Companies come in various sizes. For the simplicity of this article we’ll categorize them as small, medium, and large. The larger the company the more specialized roles become. While simultaneously imposing more rules on employees.</p>
<p>While each company has their own flavor of corporate culture. There are elements of culture all corporations share.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hierarchy</li>
<li>Bureaucracy</li>
<li>Ladder Climbing</li>
<li>Corporate Etiquette</li>
<li>Office Politics</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Hierarchy:</h4>
<p>Modeled after the army’s authoritarian structure. Corporate companies have a hierarchy of power. Those with power tell those without what to do.</p>
<p>Internal organizational charts of who reports to whom can become complex.
We can boil down corporate hierarchy into two groups, Decision Makers and Order Takers.</p>
<p>Decisions makers include the owner, executive board, department managers, and project managers. These are the people who spend their days in meetings deciding the specifics of the work that needs to get done. Then they write tickets and assign them to the employees who will do the work.</p>
<p>Remember if you don't have Manager in your title, then you're an order taker.</p>
<p>Usually employees who are assigned tasks do not get to choose what work they do. The requirements, restrictions, timeframe, and desired goal of each task is clearly defined for them.</p>
<p>In situations where tasks are written in vague terms the employee can ask for clarity to make sure they understand the solution requested and/or what deliverables to produce.</p>
<h4>Bureaucracy:</h4>
<p>Designed to maintain uniformity and control within the organization. Its purpose is to administer the company's rules and regulations. While slowing down and tracking decision-making in order to hold individuals accountable for their decisions and actions.</p>
<h4>Ladder Climbing:</h4>
<p>Typically this refers to how employees move vertically up the ranks in a corporate hierarchy. Usually through a combination of going above and beyond in completing tasks under budget and faster than expected. While simultaneously charming managers with their positive social skills.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this can result from taking credit for other people's ideas and solutions. Throwing co-works under the bus when things go wrong. Or, outright setting up other employees for failure to make themselves look better in the eyes of management.</p>
<h4>Corporate Etiquette:</h4>
<p>This is a collection of written and unwritten rules and expectations.</p>
<p>Corporate employees are held to a high standard of professional behavior. This refers to behaving appropriately at the workplace to create a positive and cooperative environment. Speaking to co-workers with respect and active listening skills are key.</p>
<h4>Office Politics:</h4>
<p>Unfortunately one of the downsides to working in a corporate environment is office politics.</p>
<p>At best office politics involves negotiations between employees and executives to create solutions for ongoing projects, improve working conditions, and progress in their career path.</p>
<p>At worst it becomes a popularity contest amongst employees with the goal of outshining co-workers to impress managers, gain favor, bonuses, and climb the corporate ladder.</p>
<p>Most companies' office politics is a mixture of both.</p>
<h3>Traditional UX/UI Designers verses Corporate UX/UI Designers</h3>
<p>There is a difference between a Traditional UX/UI Designer and a Corporate UX/UI Designer.</p>
<p><span class="strong-header">Traditional UX/UI Designers</span> work in the marketing department of startups or small to medium sized businesses. Talking directly with clients about their projects.</p>
<p>They are decision makers that choose the direction of projects. Using design thinking as a process to find the right problems to solve and iterating on various possible solutions. By conducting focus groups and surveys to gather enough end user information to create personas and journey maps.</p>
<p>When the client is happy with the proposed solution they use their research insights to create wireframes, user flows, and interactive prototypes for the client to sign off on.</p>
<p>Once the client is happy with the prototype, it is sent over to the developers who use programming code to turn it into a real working application.</p>
<p><span class="strong-header">Corporate UX/UI Designers</span> work in the product department of large corporations, usually under a project manager who assigns them tasks. This makes them order takers.</p>
<p>The corporation has Relationship Managers who interface with clients. They handle all the contracts, communication, research, and requirements gathering for projects.</p>
<p>Executives and project managers decide the colors, fonts, and layout for the project, creating a style guide without consulting the UX/UI Designer.</p>
<p>Large corporations who work under government contracts have additional requirements and restrictions that must be followed. This imposes more rules of what and how information must be displayed to users. Further reducing creative possiblities.</p>
<p>The Corporate UX/UI Designer might make suggestions based on best practices and industry standards. But, ultimately the executive team and project manager makes the design decisions.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The take away to keep in mind is the difference between decision makers and order takers.</p>
<p>Traditional UX/UI Designers are given the freedom to be decision makers. Creating visual solutions while working directly with clients. The price of that freedom is they are held accountable for the success or failure of the solutions they create.</p>
<p>In contrast, Corporate UX/UI Designers are order takers. They lack the authority to make design decisions due to the nature of their position. This means they are only responsible for completing the tasks assigned to them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>It is the executives and project managers who make the design decisions and are accountable if the project succeeds or fails.</p>
