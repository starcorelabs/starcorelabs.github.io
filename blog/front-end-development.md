Front-End Web Development can seems complex and confusing to most non-technical people.

Here's the best way I've found to describe what I do:
Front-end, sometimes called UI or UX, is everything a user sees when they visit a web page. 

It doesn't matter what browser they are using: Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, or something else. 
For security all browsers are limited to understanding only 3 scripting languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I write the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that browsers understand to makes pages display in the browser. 
I do this in a way that makes the site or application responsive. 

Which means all the components on the page and the text will grow, shrink, and shift around to adapt to the size of the screen used to view the page.

Front-End Development is a complex array of technologies that are constantly evolving. It takes time, effort, and commitment to stay updated in this rapidly changing field.

Front-End Developers need to have some proficiency with the skills listed below. This is a starting point, not an exhaustive collection.
