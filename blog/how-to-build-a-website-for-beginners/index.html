  <h1>How to Build a Website for Beginners</h1>
  <p>2019-01-01</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/laptop-code.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h3>How to Build a Website for Beginners</h3>
<p>So you've decided you want a professional website for your blog,
hobby, or business. You've looked around on Google to find a web
development company or freelancer near you. (You have looked on
Google right?).</p>
<p>You've hopefully gotten over the sticker shock of how much it costs
to build a professional website. I'm sure you've compared the prices
between different companies and decided which one offers you the
best deal based on your business needs. (If not, you should do that
now)</p>
<p>Maybe you are like most people and have no idea why its so
expensive, how websites work, how they are built, or how to use one
to earn you money. Maybe you're looking to find the cheapest person
who can to build you a site quickly. Maybe you think once its up you
can take over and do it yourself.</p>
<p>That is the road to ruin. You get what you pay for. In other words,
how can you expect them to do something for you that they haven't
done for themselves? Seems reasonable but few people apply that kind
of logic when they want a shiny new website.</p>
<p>For those &quot;Do-it-yourself&quot; type people. Don't assume because you've
used Facebook and Google that you know how to build a website.
That's like assuming because you drive your car to work, you somehow
know how to fix it when it breaks down.</p>
<p>If you do not already know how to write code or how computers work.
Trying to do it yourself will be like trying to put IKEA furniture
together in the dark. Of course I am not saying you cannot learn.
There are tons of YouTube videos and whole websites where you can
learn web development for free. I encourage everyone who has
interest and time to learn how to write code. The question is do you
want to be a developer or just own and run your own site?</p>
<p>Technically speaking you do not have to know how to write code to
setup and run a functional website for your business. Unless you
want a custom design and special features. The learning curve is
much less if you are simply writing content and marketing your
products and/or services.</p>
<p>If you do want to be a developer it will take you a minimum of 4
years to get the basics down. You'll need to learn HTML, CSS,
Responsive Design, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and Graphic Design. Along
with Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Content Writing, and SEO.
Plus, the technologies behind web development are changing everyday.
You'll have to keep up with the technology just to stay relevant. Its
a constantly moving target.</p>
<p>For those of you who are busy trying to run a business it would be
wiser to save your time and hire a professional who knows what they
are doing. Just be willing to listen to that professional since
that's why you've hired them. They have put in the time to learn all
this stuff.</p>
<p>Keep in mind having a web site doesn't mean people will instantly
find you online or give you money. Its not like winning the lotto.
Making money online is hard and takes time. There is no silver
bullet. You have to build your site correctly from the start so
people can search for you on Google. This is based on things the are
already looking for that match with what you are selling. How do you
do that? Its call Search Engine Optimization or SEO. There are whole
companies that specialize in just doing SEO for websites. That's how
deep this rabbit hole goes.</p>
<p>Having a website is like owning a puppy. You have to feed it, walk
it, and clean up after it. With a website you have to set it up
correctly, SEO, Marketing, add some kind of payment system to sell
products and/or services so people can buy from your site. Then you
have to maintain it with constant content updates. Otherwise it will
be a boring static site few people will want to visit. It will cost
you money instead of earning you money.</p>
<p>If you just want a free site to post your thoughts I suggest you go
to
<a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a>.
You'll get a limited free blog with a free domain of your choice.
However, if you want to make custom changes or use your own domain
it will cost you. Still, if you just want to post your thoughts and
add some photos its a good way to get familiar with the software.
They do not let you sell things through a free Wordpress.com
account.</p>
<p>To earn money from your website you'll need to pay for a hosted
version of the Wordpress software. Then you will need to sell a
service, product, and/or advertisements. The design of your site and
your content (written text) are all part presenting whatever you are
selling in a compelling way to entice your viewers to buy from you.
There are tons of books, videos, and websites that can teach you how
to do all of these things. However, as I pointed out previously it
takes years to learn everything you'll need to know.</p>
<p>In an effort to save you time and money I've written a short summary
of how to setup a web site for beginners. This a bare bones broad
strokes overview of how to do it. If this doesn't make sense to you
then you might want to consider hiring a professional.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank">GoDaddy.com</a>
and pick a domain. Make sure it is focused on the thing you want to
be known for or the thing you are selling. Consider thinking from
the point of view of someone who's putting a search in Google. What
would you need to type in to find the thing you are selling?</p>
<p>Buy your domain if it is available and make sure to pay the extra
$7.00 - $10.00 for privacy. It prevents people from getting your
email address and spamming you. We all get enough spam as it is.
Plus, people with a bit of knowledge can use your domain to look up
your home address. Do you really want them to show up at your house?
Get the privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can get hosting separate from your domain from many other
companies. Just search on Google for &quot;web hosting&quot;. However for the
simplicity of this article I will suggested sticking with
GoDaddy.com as well. Having your domain and hosting in the same
place, with the same company, will make it really easy to connect
the two together. They have excellent customer service and setup
everything for you if you ask them nicely. Just ask them for
Wordpress hosting. Or, if your technically you can follow their setup
guide. Either way it will only take you 10 minutes to get your site
up and running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sign-in to your site with the user name and password you created.
Use a strong password. Make sure to save it some place secure. Pick
a free theme within Wordpress. Or buy theme from
<a href="http://themeforest.net/category/wordpress">Themeforest.net</a>. Customize your theme with colors and photos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add content. Write up a compelling story about who you are, what
you do, and what you're selling. Write it from the point of view of
the people who are going to read it. Speak directly to them and tell
them how your product or service will benefit them. Keep it simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add plug-ins. Wordpress has tons of free plug-ins that let you
customize you SEO, Google Analytics, Contact Form and pull in other
website functionality. You can use YouTube for video, SoundCloud and
iTunes for music. Amazon for product sales. Mailchimp for email
marketing. Plus tons of other Social Media Marketing plug-ins. These
help you bring people to your site so they will read your content
and buy your products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SEO - Which means Search Engine Optimization. This is how people
find you on Google. Search engines like Google will scan your site
on a regular basis and rank it based on how active it is, how recent
you updated the content, how relevant your keywords are, and how
many people are linking to your site, among other things. Learn more
about SEO here: <a href="https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo">Beginners guide to SEO</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can learn inbound marketing for free on
<a href="http://www.hubspot.com/inbound-marketing">Hubspot.com</a>
This will give you a primer on how to capture people's attention and
drive traffic to your web site.</p>
