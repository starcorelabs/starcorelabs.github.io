After many years working as a UI Developer I became frustrated and burnt out with the bureaucracy of corporate web development.

To fix this problem I spent the majority of 2018 improving my UX Design skills by reading books and taking video courses.

My goal was to switch my day job from UI Development to UX Design. <br />
I finally accomplished that goal in January 2021. I'm much happier as a UX Designer.

You may be wondering, "What exactly is UX or User Experience Design?" 

Let's start with what UX Design is <strong>NOT</strong>!
- Front-End Develoment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Social Media or Email Marketing
- KPI’s (Key Performance Indicators)
- Technical or Copy Writing
- Analytics
- SEO
&nbsp;


Here's my definition of UX Design:
> UX Design is the process of creating the visual parts of software, or a web application, that users interact with. 


### UX Design Curriculum 
I based my education off of a college curriculm I found online.
Similar to these courses offered by three established colleges. 

- [New York Institute of Art + Design: User Experience (UX) Design course](https://www.nyiad.edu/courses/user-experience-ux-design/outline#unit1)
- [DePaul: BS in User Experience Design](https://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/current//Requirements-BS-in-User-Experience-Design.aspx)
- [UC Berkeley Extension: Essentials of User Experience (UX) Design](https://extension.berkeley.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=10878964#outline)

What I like most about UX Design is that I'm able to work in one application window, get into a flow, and create something beautiful and useful.

My past experience as a UI Developer working within the limitations of HTML and CSS enhances my abilities as a UX Designer.

Graphic Design and UX Design are huge skill sets that require years of study and practice to become great.
My goal was to learn the fundamentals and to develop an eye for what makes "Good Design". While learning how to use my tools more effectively.

I learned how to use common web design elements and conventions to tell a visual story. Giving users indicators to help them navigate web applications more easily. 

Learning about "[Timeless UX Design Principles](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/universal-principles-ux-design/)" helped me learn how to see things from a design perspective.

The main tool I use is Adobe XD. Its a stand alone vector-based desktop application in the family of Photoshop and Illustrator. Available for Mac and Windows.  

It gives UX Designers the ability to create mockups and interactive prototypes for web and mobile apps. These designs are used as blueprints by UI Developers for building applications. 

Here's a list of the other topics I learned. 

### Fundamentals of Graphic Design
- Line
- Color Theory
- Shape
- Texture
- Space
- Form
- Typography
- Contrast
- Hierarchy
- Alignment
- Balance
- Proximity
- Repetition
&nbsp;

### Basics of UX Design
- User Research
- Personas
- User Flows
- Usability
- Accessibility
- Wireframes
- Mockups
- Prototypes
&nbsp;


### What does a good UX Design job description look like?
Looking for a UX Design role is not easy. Its a new field and many employers confuse and combine it with other skill sets. 

I've formatted the following job description into two parts for clarification.
All Information Technology workers need to have a minimum set of professional skills.

### Professional Skills
- Adapt to change quickly
- Interpersonal skills 
- A team player but can work independently too
- Solid written and verbal communication
- Time management
- Mood control (stay calm under pressure)
- Critical thinking
- Positive “Can Do” attitude
- Creative, proactive, and solution-focused
- Growth mindset to always be learning 
- Computer literacy with Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Microsoft Office
- Internet research skills
- Familiar with Waterfall and Agile project managment styles
&nbsp;

On top of that UX Designers need to have the following knowledge and skills.

### UX Designer
- Graphic Design Fundamentals
- UX Design Fundamentals
- Mobile First Design Principles
- Understanding Responsive Design
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe XD and/or Figma
- Wireframes
- Mockups
- Prototypes
&nbsp;

### What is the average salary range for a UX Designer?
Use "UX Designer" as search term on any job listing web site. 
You'll find job descriptions with salary ranges. 

The range depends on where you are in the world and the company you're working for.<br />
In my area the range is $70k to $125k. In larger cities its higher.

### What UX Developer roles should I avoid?
When searching for a job avoid listings that have these red flags:
- No company name
- No salary range
- Any field where the cash flow might dry up
- The requirements are a combination of skill sets from three or more jobs 

UX Design is a specialized career path. It takes years of college and/or self-study to develop professional level skills. 
Its not something you can learn over a weekend. 

Remember the old saying, 
> "A jack of all trades is the master of none." 

Employers are always looking for ways to save money and maximize profit. 

In most of these situations the employer needs a team of people to fill out their marketing department. 
But either don't want to pay the cost or lack the budget to hire enough talent. 

So they try to find a "Unicorn" or "Scapegoat" to do 3 or more jobs under a single job title for one low price.
What they fail to realize is those kinds of job listings will never attract top talent and the people who apply for them are desperate. 

These "Jacks of all trades" will become overwhelmed with the workload of 3 or more jobs.
The quality of their work will be mediocre at best. Causing technical and/or legal debt at worst. 

These cheapskate employers are setting up their employees for failure, and themselves up for frustration.
They would be better off cutting back their expenses in other ways and investing in the people they need.  

On a side note, avoid Agencies that want to rent you out to clients on a per project basis.
You might as well be freelancing because you'll have more freedom and get paid better.
