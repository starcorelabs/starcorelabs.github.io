    # Outline
    - In family restaurant Waiters get paid much less than the Cooks in the kitchen. It would be unreasonable to expect the Waiters to do both jobs for their standard rate. No one would apply to or accept that job.
    - Problem: Job listings labeled as "Front-End" are misleading when they include back-end skills.
    - Solution: If companies change the title to "Web Developer" or "Full Stack" and pay an appropriate salary it would solve the problem. But recruiters don't care and Corporations want to save money.
    - In the last 5 years Companies have blended 2 or 3 jobs in one and assigning a title that earns less than one of them. Its a reverse bait and switch.
    - Its basic business. They want to pay less and get more bang for their buck.
    - At the same time Developers, who spend years learning their skills, want to earn as much as possible when applying for positions. 
    - Companies do not respect or value Front-End Developers when they them as a cache all.
    - Front-end Developers earn less than back-end programmers but are expected to do 3 times the work.
    - Bonus: Watch out for "goat" jobs. These are positions posted to hire a developer in the middle of a project so they can blame them, like a scapegoat, for poorly planned projects, errors, and mismanagement. Then fire the developer and save face with their client. 

    I've compiled salary data from a few sources:
    - Salary.com
    - LinkedIn
    - Indeed.com
    - GlassDoor.com
    - Google

    What's interesting is that Salary.com reported that both Front-End and Back-End Developers earn the same, around $100k per year.
    But, when looking at actual job listings that display salary ranges, this is not the case.
    In the Indianapolis area Back-End C# .Net Developers earn $20K - $40k more a year. 
    With more bonuses and better opportunities for raises. 
    While most Front-End jobs cap out at $80k. With fewer bonuses or raises.

    Do you see how this is 3 jobs in one for a lower than average salary?
    I dislike seeing these blended roles labeled as "Front-End Developer"
    Title: Front-End is not a Catch All. 

    If your job listing contains requires skills for 2 or more skill titles.
   Stop using "Front End Developer" as a catch all. Instead call it "Full Stack" or just a general "Web Developer".
    Yes, you might get less people applying. But those that do apply will have the skills you're looking for.

    You might ask if developers know this is a scam why would anyone apply for this job?
    There are two answers:
    1. Junior Developers either do not know its a scam or cannot land any other jobs
    2. These are the majority of the jobs Corporations are creating and the salary they are offering. 

    As developers looking for a job we have to match our skills to the available positions.
