I spent the last 6 years working as a front-end developer. Mainly focused on using CSS3, SCSS, and Bootstap to build mobile-first web application views.

For the non-technical people out there here is a different way of saying the same thing. Large companies paid me to write code that makes the visible parts of their website look good and resize itself to the screen being used to display it.

With the advent of better browser support for Modern JavaScript I'm excited to upgrade my knowledge and start building projects.

My plan is simple. Take a few online courses.
- [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript/)
- [JavaScript for React Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCwa_xi0Uuc)
- [Learn React - React Crash Course 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0&t=590s)
- [The Complete React Fullstack Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-fullstack-course/)

Then build a few demo applications to cement my knowledge and have some fun.

My current goal is to become proficient with Modern JavaScript and React. Then build a full web apps that include a majority of common components to demonstrate my ability to handle real-world applications.

As usual, my GitHub will store all the code I'm working on.
