  <h1>Artist VS Craftsman</h1>
  <p>2021-04-14</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/green-grass.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>There is a difference between Artists and Craftsmen.
This comparison points out the differences in how they operate.
And gives suggestions on how to best interact with them.</p>
<p>Both are creative and make beautiful things.
But there is a big difference in their worldview and approach.
Just like there is a big difference between talking about Skydiving
and actually jumping out of a plane.</p>
<h3>Artists</h3>
<p>Emotionally driven, passionate, rebellious, self-absorbed, and not interested in other people's opinions.</p>
<p>Artists create art to express themselves. Their emotions, ideas, and vision.
By nature they are attached to their creations.
Any changes to their art and vision is met with resistance. Sometimes this involves hostility.
Being in control is their diving factor and money is a secondary concern.</p>
<p>An artist might create a masterwork painting that you'd buy and hang on your wall.
But you wouldn't be able to hire them to paint something based on your ideas.</p>
<p>Their art is an expression of themselves.</p>
<h3>Craftsman</h3>
<p>Logical problem solvers, practical, reliable, even-tempered, collaborative, good listeners, and they ask for feedback.
You might hire a craftsman to build you a deck or a website. They work for you based on what you want.</p>
<p>Craftsmen apply their skills to create solutions for their clients.
They are not attached to the things they make.
Craftsmen are happy to make any changes the client requests.
All that matters is if the project solves the client's problem and makes them happy.</p>
<p>Crafting is about creating a practical solution for a price.</p>
<p>Now that you can tell the difference between an Artist and a Craftsman.
You'll find it easier working with them.</p>
<p>A rule of thumb to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>You buy completed art from an Artist.</li>
<li>You hire a Craftsman to create something based on your ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know many people will say my definitions are too narrow.
That some Artists are willing to be collaborative.
And, some Craftsmen are unreasonable.</p>
<p>My response is these definitions are archetypes for the purposes of giving an example.
The real world is messy and people vary wildly in their psychology and personality.</p>
<p>The point I'm making is that if you find yourself working with an irrational, self-absorbed, perfectionist. That's an Artist.
If on the other hand, you hire someone to design and build you a website and they ask a lot of questions you don’t have the answers to.
They aren't questioning your authority or trying to make you feel dumb. They're trying to collaborate with you.
You're dealing with a Craftsman who's gathering information to use as the building blocks to create the solution you want.</p>
<p>The best part is you get to decide who you'd rather work with.
If you don't want to collaborate and would rather hire someone to make all the decision for you, an Artist might be a good choice.
Of course if you want the freedom to revise things. Or, maybe you have a vision but lack the skills to make it real.
Then you're better off hiring a Craftsman.</p>
<p>Last, before you say it, &quot;There is no such thing as an Artistic Craftsman&quot;. <br />
Unicorns don't exist. You'd be better off chasing rainbows looking for a pot of gold.</p>
