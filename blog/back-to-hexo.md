As a project to demonstrate my front-end design and development skills I made a UX wireframe of my website. 
Then used it as a mockup to code my own custom Wordpress Theme from scratch.

I recorded videos of the process and posted them on my YouTube channel.
I named the series "[Wireframe to Wordpress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB4vVkDTaew&list=PLtO-pPfi3wPGgEo1Y5MOoGpxWxTbvKKuN)". 

I learned a lot going through the process of designing and coding my own custom Wordpress theme. 
've stored the final version of the code on my GitHub. I might update it for public use sometime in the future.

Near the end of this process the bill for my Wordpress hosting came due. Paying to host a website that doesn't generate revenue became too expensive. Plus, everyday my Wordpress website firewall reported about 120+ hacking attempts.  

For simplicity and peace of mind I decided to use [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) the static site generator.

Now this site is being hosted on GitHub Pages and I'm using my GitHub repositories as my design and development portfolio. I can demonstrate the code I've written without the overhead and security issues associated with Wordpress.

I'm much happier with Hexo than I was with Wordpress.
