  <h1>Avoid Bad Design Jobs</h1>
  <p>2021-04-25</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/wooden-deck.png" alt="img"></p>
<h3>Why We Specilize</h3>
<p><a href="https://starcorelabs.com/blog/ux-ui-design/">UX/UI Design</a> is a specialized career path. It takes years of college and/or self-study to develop professional level skills.
Its not something you can learn over a weekend.</p>
<p>Like Medicine, Information Technology is a huge field.
No one person can know it all.</p>
<p>One area of knowledge is not equivalent to another. In otherwords, its unreasonable to expect a tech support agent to know how to build a web application.</p>
<p>Just like you'd never expect a Nurse to know how to do brain surgery.</p>
<p>Both the Nurse and Surgeon are in the field of medicine and have spent years learning their specialized skill sets.
Their skills might overlap in some small areas but their skill sets are not equivalent.</p>
<h3>Three Reasons Your Job Title Matters</h3>
<ol>
<li>College curriculms teach specific skill sets based on a job title.</li>
<li>Your title connects your skill set to your salary range.</li>
<li>Job tiles are search terms on job listing sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, and CareerBuilder.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>With sites like <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm">Glassdoor</a> and <a href="https://www.salary.com/">Salary.com</a> there is no excuse for employers to not know the differences. Those who low-ball on salary or combine two or more jobs are being shady to save money.</p>
<h3>Here's an Example of a Bad Design Job</h3>
<p>This was listed as a &quot;UX Design&quot; role for a mid-sized company.
But when you look at the skill sets they want to fill this role its clear this is 5 jobs in one.</p>
<p>It is unrealistic to redefine the skills for job title to save money and hope to fool smart people.
The people with the intelligence and skills to do this level of work are smart enough to see through this game.</p>
<p>I've highlighted the individual jobs hidden in the example below with different colors to make it easier to pick them out. If this was a true UX Design job it would be 90% blue.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="f-red">Project Manager = Red</span></li>
<li><span class="f-orange">Marketing Lead = Orange</span></li>
<li><span class="f-green">Technical Copy Writer = Green</span></li>
<li><span class="f-blue">UX/UI Designer = Blue</span></li>
<li><span class="f-purple">Front-End Developer = Purple</span><br>
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>What does a good UX/UI Design job description look like?</h3>
<p>Looking for a UX/UI Design role is not easy. Its a new field and many employers confuse and combine it with other skill sets.</p>
<p>I've formatted the following job description into two parts for clarification.
All Information Technology workers need to have a minimum set of professional skills.</p>
<h3>Professional Skills</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adapt to change quickly</li>
<li>Interpersonal skills</li>
<li>A team player but can work independently too</li>
<li>Solid written and verbal communication</li>
<li>Time management</li>
<li>Mood control (stay calm under pressure)</li>
<li>Critical thinking</li>
<li>Positive “Can Do” attitude</li>
<li>Creative, proactive, and solution-focused</li>
<li>Growth mindset to always be learning</li>
<li>Computer literacy with Windows, Mac, and Linux</li>
<li>Microsoft Office</li>
<li>Internet research skills</li>
<li>Familiar with Waterfall and Agile style project management
 </li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that UX/UI Designers need to have the following knowledge and skills.</p>
<h3>UX/UI Designer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Graphic Design Fundamentals</li>
<li>UX/UI Design Fundamentals</li>
<li>Mobile First Design Principles</li>
<li>Understanding Responsive Design</li>
<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
<li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
<li>Adobe XD and/or Figma</li>
<li>Wireframes</li>
<li>Mockups</li>
<li>Prototypes
 </li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the average salary range for a UX/UI Designer?</h3>
<p>Use &quot;UX Designer&quot; as search term on any job listing web site.<br />
Look for job descriptions with salary ranges.</p>
<p>The range depends on where you are in the world, your experience, and the company you're working for.
In my area the range is $70k to $125k. In larger cities its higher.</p>
<h3>What UX/UI Designer roles should I avoid?</h3>
<p>When searching for a job avoid listings that have these red flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>No company name</li>
<li>No salary range</li>
<li>Any industry where the cash flow might dry up due to COVID</li>
<li>Requirements are a combination of skill sets from three or more jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember the old saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A jack of all trades is the master of none.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Employers are always looking for ways to save money and maximize profit.</p>
<p>In most situations the employer needs a team of people.
But either doesn't want to pay the cost or lacks the budget to hire enough talent.</p>
<p>So they try to find a &quot;Unicorn&quot; to do 3 or more jobs under a single job title for one low price.
What they fail to realize is these job listings will never attract top talent and the people who apply for them are desperate.</p>
<p>These &quot;Jacks of all trades&quot; will become overwhelmed with the workload of 3 or more jobs.
The quality of their work will be mediocre at best. Causing technical and/or legal debt at worst.
They will eventually burn out and quit, or mess up badly and get fired.</p>
<p>These cheapskate employers are setting up their employees for failure, and themselves for frustration.
They would be better off cutting back their expenses in other areas and investing in the people they need.</p>
<p>Also, avoid Agencies that want to rent you out to clients on a per project basis.
You might as well be freelancing because you'll have more freedom and get paid better.</p>
