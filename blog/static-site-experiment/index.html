  <h1>Static Site Experiments</h1>
  <p>2020-09-01</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/pier.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h2>Welcome Back to the Lab!</h2>
<p>In my last update I explained I was working on updating my website to include both my blog and portfolio.
To do this I wanted to switch from <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo.io</a> to <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty.dev</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to switch because Hexo breaks while developing with it and it lacks the ability to easily support both a blog and a portfolio.
So, instead of creating a bunch of custom code to make it work I decided to find a more robust alternative.</p>
<p>I watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOSLUtJ_J3rrJ1R1qEf8CCEpV3GgbJGNr">YouTube tutorial</a> to learn how to convert my static HTML theme into an 11ty site. After that I spent a week converting my site over to 11ty.</p>
<p>During development there were a few issues I had to work through:</p>
<ul>
<li>The blog listing page wouldn't show any items. I double checked my &quot;for loop&quot;. The solution was to rename the json file so it matched the folder it was located in.</li>
<li>I had to create templates for all the different page and post types:
<ul>
<li>postlist.njk</li>
<li>post.njk</li>
<li>projectlist.njk</li>
<li>project.njk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All of images were too large so I spent 2 hours using Gimp to resize them. This reduced their dimensions and file size.</li>
<li>I found the post and project images didn't work with the template syntax. So I used relative paths instead.</li>
<li>Due to the limitations in markdown I had to use HTML img tags so I could assign classes for styling.</li>
<li>I used flexbox to fix my skills section to layout the icons correctly.</li>
<li>I wanted to create an include for the &quot;about&quot; section. But could not get it working. So I put it in the homepage.njk file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last I wanted 11ty to output a fully working static site to the &quot;_site&quot; folder so I could manually deploy it to GitHub Pages.
Unfortunately, it seems 11ty was designed with Netlify in mind.
After reading through the sales pitch and documentation of Netlify I decided it is not for me.</p>
<p>The whole point of creating a static site is so I can host it for free on GitHub Pages.
This site is a blog and a place to showcase my projects. I'm not processing any forms or accepting user data.</p>
<p>I think 11ty is great. But the documentation is lacking and assumes too much pre-existing knowledge on the part of its users.
Its definitely not for beginners.</p>
<p>The issue I haven't solve yet is that 11ty requires all CSS, JS, and image paths to start with &quot;/&quot;.
While the local development server is running the site works flawlessly.</p>
<p>However, opening up the index.html rendered static file in &quot;_site&quot; folder shows a broken site in Chrome.</p>
<p>I spent a couple of days researching to find a solution.
I experimented with &quot;pathPrefix&quot; in my eleventy.js config.
It adds the ability to render the site in a subfolder.
Not remove the starting &quot;/&quot; from the file paths.</p>
<p>I tried using this code <pre><code> {{ '/' | url }} </pre></code> as a relative path substitute for my CSS, JS, and images.</p>
<p>But it only adds the &quot;/&quot; to the paths in the final output.</p>
<p>I've asked questions on the 11ty GitHub without response.
On StackOverFlow I received one answer suggesting that static sites made with 11ty can only be deployed using the for profit company Netlify.</p>
<p>This really irritated me because nothing on the 11ty website suggests this is the case.</p>
<p>I keep thinking its all just JavaScript so there must be a way to program the site to render a working local version.
I'm just not skilled enough with JavaScript yet to do it.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting around I decided to copy the rendered output to another folder and manually fix all the file paths so the site works.
Yes this really sucks. But, I need my site up and running now.</p>
<p>So, I'm currently stuck until I either figure out how to fix this glaring issue that other static site generators don't have.
Or spend another week learning and switching to something else.</p>
<p>Going forward I will check to make sure whatever software I choose can output the files I need before I invest my time an energy building with it.</p>
<p>One thing I won't do is use Netlify because I will not give up ownership of my website to a for-profit company.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Update 2020-09-06: Eleventy Works!</h3>
<p>I sent the last few days trying to figure out how to set 11ty to generate relative links.
I was under the impression that if it didn't work locally it wouldn't work on GitHub Pages. Sometimes its good to be wrong.</p>
<p>On the 11ty GitHub repo under issues I asked for help with deploying my 11ty site to Github Pages.
Thankfully a few people offer suggestions.</p>
<p>Finally one person cloned my repo and pushed the contents from _site folder to their own username.github.io repo to test it.
I was shocked that it actually worked.</p>
<p>I did the same thing in my dev lab. Again I was surprised that it actually works.</p>
<p>So I'm going to stick with 11ty as my static site generator.
Now I can focus on adding posts and projects.</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone who helped!</p>
