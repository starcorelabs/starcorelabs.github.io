            <p>2019-01-01</p>
            <p>
            <p><img src="../assets/img/post-images/laptop-code.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="img"></p>
            <h3>How to Build a Website for Beginners</h3>
            <p>So you've decided you want a professional website for your blog,
                hobby, or business. You've looked around on Google to find a web
                development company or freelancer near you. (You have looked on
                Google right?).</p>
            <p>You've hopefully gotten over the sticker shock of how much it costs
                to build a professional website. I'm sure you've compared the prices
                between different companies and decided which one offers you the
                best deal based on your business needs. (If not, you should do that
                now)</p>
            <p>Maybe you are like most people and have no idea why its so
                expensive, how websites work, how they are built, or how to use one
                to earn you money. Maybe you're looking to find the cheapest person
                who can to build you a site quickly. Maybe you think once its up you
                can take over and do it yourself.</p>
            <p>That is the road to ruin. You get what you pay for. In other words,
                how can you expect them to do something for you that they haven't
                done for themselves? Seems reasonable but few people apply that kind
                of logic when they want a shiny new website.</p>
            <p>For those &quot;Do-it-yourself&quot; type people. Don't assume because you've
                used Facebook and Google that you know how to build a website.
                That's like assuming because you drive your car to work, you somehow
                know how to fix it when it breaks down.</p>
            <p>If you do not already know how to write code or how computers work.
                Trying to do it yourself will be like trying to put IKEA furniture
                together in the dark. Of course I am not saying you cannot learn.
                There are tons of YouTube videos and whole websites where you can
                learn web development for free. I encourage everyone who has
                interest and time to learn how to write code. The question is do you
                want to be a developer or just own and run your own site?</p>
            <p>Technically speaking you do not have to know how to write code to
                setup and run a functional website for your business. Unless you
                want a custom design and special features. The learning curve is
                much less if you are simply writing content and marketing your
                products and/or services.</p>
            <p>If you do want to be a developer it will take you a minimum of 4
                years to get the basics down. You'll need to learn HTML, CSS,
                Responsive Design, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and Graphic Design. Along
                with Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Content Writing, and SEO.
                Plus, the technologies behind web development are changing everyday.
                You'll have to keep up with the technology just to stay relevant. Its
                a constantly moving target.</p>
            <p>For those of you who are busy trying to run a business it would be
                wiser to save your time and hire a professional who knows what they
                are doing. Just be willing to listen to that professional since
                that's why you've hired them. They have put in the time to learn all
                this stuff.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind having a web site doesn't mean people will instantly
                find you online or give you money. Its not like winning the lotto.
                Making money online is hard and takes time. There is no silver
                bullet. You have to build your site correctly from the start so
                people can search for you on Google. This is based on things the are
                already looking for that match with what you are selling. How do you
                do that? Its call Search Engine Optimization or SEO. There are whole
                companies that specialize in just doing SEO for websites. That's how
                deep this rabbit hole goes.</p>
            <p>Having a website is like owning a puppy. You have to feed it, walk
                it, and clean up after it. With a website you have to set it up
                correctly, SEO, Marketing, add some kind of payment system to sell
                products and/or services so people can buy from your site. Then you
                have to maintain it with constant content updates. Otherwise it will
                be a boring static site few people will want to visit. It will cost
                you money instead of earning you money.</p>
            <p>If you just want a free site to post your thoughts I suggest you go
                to
                <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a>.
                You'll get a limited free blog with a free domain of your choice.
                However, if you want to make custom changes or use your own domain
                it will cost you. Still, if you just want to post your thoughts and
                add some photos its a good way to get familiar with the software.
                They do not let you sell things through a free Wordpress.com
                account.</p>
            <p>To earn money from your website you'll need to pay for a hosted
                version of the Wordpress software. Then you will need to sell a
                service, product, and/or advertisements. The design of your site and
                your content (written text) are all part presenting whatever you are
                selling in a compelling way to entice your viewers to buy from you.
                There are tons of books, videos, and websites that can teach you how
                to do all of these things. However, as I pointed out previously it
                takes years to learn everything you'll need to know.</p>
            <p>In an effort to save you time and money I've written a short summary
                of how to setup a web site for beginners. This a bare bones broad
                strokes overview of how to do it. If this doesn't make sense to you
                then you might want to consider hiring a professional.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Go to <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/" target="_blank">GoDaddy.com</a>
                        and pick a domain. Make sure it is focused on the thing you want to
                        be known for or the thing you are selling. Consider thinking from
                        the point of view of someone who's putting a search in Google. What
                        would you need to type in to find the thing you are selling?</p>
                    <p>Buy your domain if it is available and make sure to pay the extra
                        $7.00 - $10.00 for privacy. It prevents people from getting your
                        email address and spamming you. We all get enough spam as it is.
                        Plus, people with a bit of knowledge can use your domain to look up
                        your home address. Do you really want them to show up at your house?
                        Get the privacy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You can get hosting separate from your domain from many other
                        companies. Just search on Google for &quot;web hosting&quot;. However for the
                        simplicity of this article I will suggested sticking with
                        GoDaddy.com as well. Having your domain and hosting in the same
                        place, with the same company, will make it really easy to connect
                        the two together. They have excellent customer service and setup
                        everything for you if you ask them nicely. Just ask them for
                        Wordpress hosting. Or, if your technically you can follow their setup
                        guide. Either way it will only take you 10 minutes to get your site
                        up and running.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sign-in to your site with the user name and password you created.
                        Use a strong password. Make sure to save it some place secure. Pick
                        a free theme within Wordpress. Or buy theme from
                        <a href="http://themeforest.net/category/wordpress">Themeforest.net</a>. Customize your theme
                        with
                        colors and photos.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add content. Write up a compelling story about who you are, what
                        you do, and what you're selling. Write it from the point of view of
                        the people who are going to read it. Speak directly to them and tell
                        them how your product or service will benefit them. Keep it simple.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add plug-ins. Wordpress has tons of free plug-ins that let you
                        customize you SEO, Google Analytics, Contact Form and pull in other
                        website functionality. You can use YouTube for video, SoundCloud and
                        iTunes for music. Amazon for product sales. Mailchimp for email
                        marketing. Plus tons of other Social Media Marketing plug-ins. These
                        help you bring people to your site so they will read your content
                        and buy your products.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>SEO - Which means Search Engine Optimization. This is how people
                        find you on Google. Search engines like Google will scan your site
                        on a regular basis and rank it based on how active it is, how recent
                        you updated the content, how relevant your keywords are, and how
                        many people are linking to your site, among other things. Learn more
