## Welcome back to the lab!
The last big update like this was the [August 2020 Update](http://starcorelabs.com/blog/august-update/).

Since then I've been doing my best to stay sane and healthy.<br/>
Like many of you I'm feeling fatigued from all the conflict and uncertainty regarding current events.
Which is why I refuse to comment on any of it.

Recently, I've had a few freeloaders attempt to get "Something for Nothing" from me.<br/>
I shut them down by quoting prices for my services.<br/>
And directly asking, "What's in it for me?"

They respond with predictable shock acting offended by saying,<br/>
"You're going to charge me? I thought we were friends?!"

My real friends know better than to ask me to do anything for free.<br/>
The only free things I offer are on this website.<br/>

I've got bills to pay. Either hire me or don't waste my time.<br/>
You won't work for free and neither will I.

Aside from those minor interruptions I've been improving my skills. 

### Coding Skill Growth

I do this by continuously improving my existing skills while learning new ones.

### Freelance Web Development
Back in August I was preparing to start Freelancing. 

Since then I've been working hard behind the scenes setting up my business.<br/> 
Reading books and taking courses from highly regarded professionals in the field.

[Learning to Build Trust and Credibility](https://www.inc.com/lolly-daskal/99-simple-ways-you-can-build-trust-and-credibility.html) based on my proven track record of professionalism and delivering creative solutions.

### POP OS Upgrade
![img](../../assets/img/post-images/pop-os-20.10.png)

With the recent release of [POP OS 20.10](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/10/pop-os-20-10-released). 
I decided it was time for a fresh install on my main desktop. 

Here's the hardware info:

To save time reinstalling all my utilities and apps I made a github repo to store my [POP OS Setup](https://github.com/starcorelabs/pop-os-setup) file and post install script. 

I plan on installing a fresh copy of POP OS 20.10 on 2 other computers. My repo will make the post-install setup process take less than 20 minutes.
