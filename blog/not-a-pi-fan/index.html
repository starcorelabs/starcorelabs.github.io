  <h1>Raspberry Pi is not for me.</h1>
  <p>2020-11-28</p>

<h2>Raspberry Pi is Great</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi line of single board computers are great for students, hobbyists, and tinkerers.</p>
<p>They are low-cost and low-powered devices used as a platform to build many kinds of electronic projects.</p>
<p>The top 5 projects seem to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning Linux</li>
<li>Python Programming</li>
<li>Retro Pi Gaming</li>
<li>Plex Media Server</li>
<li>Network Attached Storage</li>
</ol>
<h2>Old Pi</h2>
<p>Back in 2011 I bought a first generation model b rev 2 Raspberry Pi.
It has an ARMv6 processor running at 700Mhz with 512MB of ram.
At the time it was a new shiny gadget that seemed cool.</p>
<p>The $40.00 kit came with a Pi, power supply, acrylic case, and HDMI cable.
I thought after setting it up I'd find a use for it.</p>
<p>It came with an 8GB SD card with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">Noobs</a> on it.
Upon boot I selected the default Rasbian OS (now known as <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/">Raspberry Pi OS</a>)</p>
<p>At the time I had run other versions of Linux so it wasn't a new experience for me.
In fact, I was disappointed at how slow the Pi was and the overall look and feel of Rasbian OS.
It seemed more like a kids toy than a real computer.</p>
<p>The mouse moved ok when nothing else was running.
Attempting to open the file manager or launching an app took minutes and stopped the mouse or anything else from running.
Browsing the web was a nightmare. And due to its hardware limitations I found it impossible to watch videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>I looked online for ideas on what I could use it for.
The main four things people seemed to be using the Pi for was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning Linux and Python Programming</li>
<li>Retro Pi Gaming</li>
<li>Plex Media Server</li>
<li>Network Attached Storage</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time I already had an old, more powerful, desktop running linux and I wasn't interested in learning Python.</p>
<p>So, I spent a day setting up Retro Pi to play old school NES and SNES games.
It worked fairly well for single player but slowed down and crashed for dual players.</p>
<p>I played retro games on it for about 2 hours. Then it sat gathering dust for a few months.</p>
<p>I wanted to use it for something else. I already had a Plex Media Server.</p>
<p>Finally I decided to add a 1TB external drive and use the Pi as an always on NAS.
I spent two days trying to get OwnCloud to work on the Pi. But it kept having problems.</p>
<p>Then I switched to NextCloud and after another 4 hours I got it working.
I installed the desktop client and used it to sync files. It worked well enough.
It wouldn't upload files bigger than 500mb.</p>
<p>I had to edit the config files to overcome these limits.
After another day of trail and error I got it working the way I wanted.</p>
<p>I used it like this for about a week before I shut it down.
Having an external drive running all the time is not good.
Even if its set to spin down when not in use.</p>
<p>Mostly I was disappointed with the upload and download speeds when adding or accessing files.</p>
<p>So this old Raspberry Pi has sat unused gathering dust for a few years.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yesterday I decided to try and put it to use again.</p>
