My career as a UI Developer has mostly been styling pages using CSS. 

Making web applications look good cross-browser while being mobile friendly is hard. CSS is a huge topic that many technical authors have written books about. 

One of my favorites is: [The Book of CSS3, 2nd Edition: A Developer's Guide to the Future of Web Design](https://www.amazon.com/Book-CSS3-2nd-Developers-Future/dp/1593275803/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=The+Book+of+CSS3&qid=1580782783&sr=8-1)

To be able to build the kind of interactive applications I dream about, I need something more than CSS. 

So I've been learning React for the last month. Here's the resources I'm using: 

#### Resources
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [JavaScript for React Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCwa_xi0Uuc&t=4s) 
- [React Crash Course 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0&t=338s) 
- [The React Handbook](https://reacthandbook.com) 
- [The React Cheatsheet for 2020](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-react-cheatsheet-for-2020/)
&nbsp;

#### Learning Milestones
- ES6+ aka ECMAScript2015
- What is a React component?
- ReactDOM rendering
- Class vs functional components
- JSX
- State
- Event handling
- Asynchronous setState
- Props
- Refs
&nbsp;

My goal is to learn enough to add interactive projects to my portfolio. 
Here's a few ideas I'm considering. 

#### React Projects
- Use [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (built on React) to create a portfolio with a blog.
- To Do list
- Social Media App like Twitter 
- E-Commerce App
- Media App 
- Messaging App
&nbsp;

Learning React is going to take time and practice. 
But so far I'm enjoying the journey.
