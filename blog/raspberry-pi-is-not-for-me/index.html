  <h1>Raspberry Pi is not for me.</h1>
  <p>2020-11-28</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/first-gen-raspberry-pi-model-b.png" alt="img"></p>
<h2>Raspberry Pi is Great</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi line of single board computers are great for low-powered always-on projects. They are meant for students, hobbyists, and tinkerers.</p>
<p>The top 5 projects seem to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learning Linux</li>
<li>Python Programming</li>
<li>Retro Pi Gaming</li>
<li>Plex Media Server</li>
<li>NextCloud Network Attached Storage</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, after years of experimenting with a Pi I've realized it's not for me.</p>
<h2>My Old Pi</h2>
<p>Back in 2011 I bought a 1st gen model b rev 2 Raspberry Pi. (pictured in the photo above) <br/></p>
<p>It has an ARMv6 processor running at 700Mhz with 512MB of ram. The $40.00 kit came with a Pi, power supply, acrylic case, an 8GB SD Card with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">Noobs</a> and HDMI cable.</p>
<p>I didn't initially have an idea of what I wanted to do with it. I thought after setting it up I'd find a use for it.</p>
<p>Upon boot I selected the default Rasbian OS (now known as <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/">Raspberry Pi OS</a>) and spent 20 minutes checking out the desktop.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/raspbian-desktop.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>At the time I had already had a desktop running Linux so it wasn't a new experience for me.</p>
<p>In fact, I was disappointed by the slow performance of the Pi and the look and feel of Rasbian OS. It seemed more like a kids toy than a real computer.</p>
<p>Attempting to open the file manager or launching an app took minutes and stopped the mouse or anything else from running.
Browsing the web was a nightmare. And due to its hardware limitations I found it impossible to watch videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>I did some research online looking for a good use for my Pi.</p>
<p>I spent a few hours setting up Retro Pi and played some single player NES and SNES games.
It worked fairly well but there were a few games that ran slowly with errors.</p>
<p>After the installation of Retro Pi I used it about 3 times and once the novelty wore off it sat turned off and unused for about a year.</p>
<p>Then I tried connecting a 1TB drive and using it as a low-power always-on NAS. I ended up wasting 2 days researching and tinkering trying to get NextCloud to work.
When I got it working I found, yet again, the hardware was too slow to be of any practical use.</p>
<p>The file transfer speeds were bottlenecked by the slow processor. At this point I was frustrated and couldn't think of a good use for the Pi.</p>
<p>I turned it off and let it sit unused ever since.</p>
<h2>Recycled Desktop Solution</h2>
<p>The Raspberry Pi projects listed above can be accomplished with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">POP OS</a> and an inexpensive used desktop PC.
The PC will have more power, speed, and reliability, but cost more in electricity.</p>
<p>Again, Raspberry Pi single board computers are great for low-powered always-on projects.</p>
<p>They are not for me because I cannot justify spending any money on a device that doesn't fit my needs.</p>
