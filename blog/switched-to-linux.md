I own three desktops and a laptop. After 8 months of frustration with Windows 10 I switched my computers to Linux. I wrote a post about it [3 Reasons I Quit Windows 10](/blog/3-reasons-i-quit-windows-10/).

My main workstation desktop is running [Linux Mint Cinnamon](https://linuxmint.com/). This is a custom desktop computer I build myself from parts bought online from [Newegg](https://www.newegg.com/). Its about 7 years old and I'm itching to build or buy something better.

Since I use my computers mainly for design and web development they don't need to be super powerful gaming systems.

I installed Linux Mint XFCE on my old Dell Vostro Laptop for minor tasks. As well as on my old HP Pro 3130 MT desktop I use as a media server. I wrote a post that goes into more detail about my [Plex Server](/blog/plex-media-server/).

My 3rd desktop is a File Server running [Open Media Vault](https://www.openmediavault.org/). This one is another custom desktop I built from parts purchased from [Fry's](https://www.frys.com/).

Its been a few months since I switched to Linux and I don't miss Windows at all. Its not for everyone but it works for me.
