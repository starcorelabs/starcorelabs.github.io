  <h1>How to Talk to a UI Designer</h1>
  <p>2021-07-24</p>

<p>This post is meant to help you communicate effectively with UI Designers. The more clearly you can state your request, the faster and more accurately they can provide you with a design.</p>
<p>Modern web and mobile applications are built on a digital assembly line. It takes teams of skilled people from high level executives to managers, project managers, designers, and developers to build out a full application. This means clear communication within the team is essential to efficient operations.</p>
<p>UI Design is an exact visual science. Software like Adobe XD is used to create visual designs for web and mobile applications. It uses precise mathematical values for color, shape, and placement of elements on a digital artboard that uses an invisible grid.</p>
<p>For UI Designers &quot;being creative&quot; while working on a web application means solving problems through creating and positioning common components. These include images, menus, lists, tables, forms, buttons, and text copy.</p>
<p>Within some corporate environments there is little room for being creative when the project style guide has already been established. The tasks have previously been determined by a committee further up the assembly line. And, they've decided on each component's color, shape, size, and placement per page.</p>
<p>In this situation the UI Designer is like a bricklayer who is building to a specification. Being assigned tasks through tickets and/or meetings with little to no creative input.</p>
<p>Once a design task has been completed it moves down the assembly line to the developers who turn it into code. Sometimes the developers don't follow the design exactly. Instead they approximate the design within the limitations of their own skills and those imposed by the coding languages they use.</p>
<p>The UI Designer can only alter the designs within their software tools based on the tasks assigned to them. How and what the developers do with those designs is up to the Manager of Development.</p>
<p>Wherever you are in the corporate hierarchy at some time you may need to talk with a UI Designer. You might need some new design, a change to an existing design, or some other graphical asset.</p>
<p>If you follow the suggestions below when talking with UI Designers you'll have a smoother experience.</p>
<h3>5 Rules of thumb for talking with a UI Designer</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Context matters. Make sure you and your UI Designer are looking at the exact same thing. Its best to focus on XD files the UI Designer can update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know specifically what you want before talking with your UI Designer. Unfortunately UI Designers cannot read minds. There are many different ways to design a button, or other components. Given creative freedom the UI Designer will usually make something you won't like. Because their intuition and aesthetics will be different than yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe your request using visual terms in relation to the specific item you want created or changed. Remember specific directions, will give you specific results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus on the &quot;Look and Feel&quot;. Adobe XD is a powerful design application. It can mimic simple behaviors like pressing a button to show another page. But this feature is limited. Its better to leave complex behavior to the developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep tasks focused on the immediate visual change requested. Project managers are accustomed to thinking about the big picture of a project and all the moving parts. UI Designers prefer to focus on the placement of specific components within a specific area or page. This narrow focus allows UI Designers to accomplish their tasks faster.
