As a front-end developer I'm always updating my skills. Because this industry changes fast.

Recently I was watching a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTlczfR82mQ) of a developer demonstrating some features of Flexbox which I hadn't seen before.

During the video the instructor said there was [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) on the famous CSS Tricks Website.

So after finishing the video I had to go dig into the guide to learn more.

Then I saw that CSS Tricks has [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) which made me even happier.

I've used both Flexbox and CSS Grid in a few projects and found they are easy to use, supported in all modern browsers (all the ones that matter), and remove the need for bloated, slow, overly-engineered CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation.

I plan on using both Flexbox and CSS Grid combined with [Viewport Units](https://css-tricks.com/fun-viewport-units/) in all my future projects, where applicable.
