  <h1>Effective Project Management</h1>
  <p>2021-02-06</p>
  <p><p><img src="../../assets/img/post-images/fish-pond.png" alt="img"></p>
<h3>Tracking progress is hard</h3>
<p>Companies need a reliable way to know the percentage of progress employees are making on assigned tasks.<br>
The default choice is to schedule meetings and spend 30 minutes talking.</p>
<p>Asking questions like, &quot;What did you do yesterday? What are you doing today? Do you have any blocker?&quot;</p>
<p>These meetings cause the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are speed bumps on the race track of the companies productivity.</li>
<li>Pulling teams away from actively working on tasks stops progress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preventive Measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Companies that don't do requirements gathering in the beginning of a project. Will pay for it with bug fixing at the end.</li>
<li>Part of the onboarding process should include a guide to defintions of interal terms and accronyms along with training on where to find answers within the company.</li>
<li>Do not create corporate policies or procedures that bottleneck your employees by keeping them from asking questions or stopping them from completing tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scrum is the worst</h3>
<p>Many companies claiming to be Agile are actually using a poor watered down imitation and/or hybrid method.
At this point the umbrella term &quot;Agile&quot; has lost any real meaning.</p>
<p>Most corporate software is developed based on the desires of the CEO or Department manager.
Little to no client / customer feedbacks is taken into account.</p>
<p>Any outside interference or influence in development of properitry applications could result in a breach of contract.
Which would put the company in legal trouble.</p>
<p>There is a better way for management to keep track of employees' progress.</p>
<h3>Alternative Options</h3>
<p>Before I became a developer I worked in technical support. One company had an internal website.
They had a company blog that got updated almost daily. These posts were ususally management bragging about their quarterly earns.
How many new accounts they landed. Company updates and policy changes.
Information employees needed to be aware of but nothing that actually impacted their work or required a response.</p>
<p>I liked that internal news feed because it got me up to speed quickly in the morning.
Without filling my inbox with emails I wouldn't read again or wasting my time in meetings that were information dumps.</p>
<p>When I switched to being a web developer I was shocked that corporate companies do not employ an internal news feed or a knowledge base.</p>
<p>In my opinion companies should follow the DRY and KISS principles.
Don't Repeat Yourself and Keep It Simple Stupid.</p>
<h3>Keys</h3>
<ul>
<li>Single Source of Truth (A single person is responible for keeping project goals alinged. Master Prototype and daily updated interal news feed)</li>
<li>Non-Disruptive Automated Progress Tracking (No Meetings and Project Manager Admin Panel)</li>
<li>Use internal knowledge base and templates for components to speed up development. (Don't waste time solving problems) (included XD and Code)</li>
<li>Parallel Development (Everyone working on their tasks at the same time.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't build speed bumps on your race track.</li>
<li>Pulling teams away from actively working on tasks to ask them about their progress, slows progress.</li>
<li>If you don't do requirements gathering in the beginning. You'll pay for it with bug fixing at the end.</li>
<li>Part of the onboarding process should include a short training course on where to find answers within the company.</li>
<li>Do not create corporate policies or proceedures that bottleneck your emloyees by keeping them from asking questions or stopping them from completing tasks.</li>
</ul>
