So you're curious about learning linux. Good news! Its easy to get started and its free.

### Desktop Linux
Modern Linux distributions (distros) are easy to install, configure, and use. Once you adopt the right mindset and understand the basics of how linux works. Using linux to accomplish daily tasks becomes easy. Linux gives you more choices, control, and privacy.

There are many ways to learn Linux.

First you'll need to download an ISO disk image using an existing computer. Personally I use [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) with the Cinnamon desktop. Here's an article that will help you find a distro that's right for you.

If you have a decently powerful desktop running Windows or Mac you'll be able to run a Linux Operating System inside a program called [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

Here's a quick video demonstrating how to download and install Linux Mint inside VirtualBox.

A better approach is to setup a dedicated desktop or laptop as a linux machine. Immersing yourself in using linux daily will help you learn faster.

If you're learning Linux using a Raspberry Pi here's a couple of operating systems you can try.
- [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
- [DietPi](https://dietpi.com/)

To install linux on a dedicated computer you'll need a USB flash drive and a program to properly copy your linux ISO image to your flash drive. I recommend using [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) because its free and easy.

Pro Tip: No matter what other sources tell you. Please DO NOT dual boot! You can avoid the critical error most beginners make. As you are learning linux you will mess up your system from time to time. If it is running in VirtualBox or on a dedicated secondary computer, no problem. You can take your time troubleshooting and/or simply reinstall the OS.

Otherwise, if you dual boot with Windows or Mac OS X and mess things up, it could be bad. You might damage your primary OS files so the system will no longer boot. Or you could delete your entire hard drive. Losing all the files you've forgotten to backup.

I've done both a few times. Thankfully, I had backups and didn't lose anything. Over time you'll gain enough knowledge and skill to avoid causing similar catastrophic system failures.

Once you're comfortable with the basics of the desktop version of linux. You might continue using it as your daily OS. Only using Windows on a dedicated computer for gaming, if you're into PC games.

### Linux Professional
If you fall in love with linux and want to turn your new skills into a career. You might start looking into becoming a Linux System Administrator or SysAdmin.

Before investing time and money learning this complex set of skills and earning a bachelor's degree. Take a moment to find out if there is demand for Linux System Administrators in your area. It would really suck to spend 2 to 4 years investing in a college education if there are no jobs available when you finish.

Take 20 minutes to search for "Linux Administrator" on these websites. Gauge the level of demand and the requirements for the roles. This will give you a better idea of the real world skills and experience companies expect from their employees.

Pro Tip: If you're interested in being a Systems Administrator, consider looking into DevOps. This is where all the windows and linux system admins are heading these days. Keep in mind many companies require a bachelor's degree for these positions. Certifications might prove you know the basics. But if you're competing against people with bachelor's degrees you won't get a chance at interviews.
