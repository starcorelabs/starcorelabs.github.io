## Raspberry Pi is Great
The Raspberry Pi line of single board computers are great for low-powered always-on projects. They are meant for students, hobbyists, and tinkerers. 

The top 5 projects seem to be:
1. Learning Linux
2. Python Programming
3. Retro Pi Gaming
4. Plex Media Server
5. NextCloud Network Attached Storage

Unfortunately, after years of experimenting with a Pi I've realized it's not for me.

## My Old Pi
Back in 2011 I bought a 1st gen model b rev 2 Raspberry Pi. (pictured in the photo above) <br/>

It has an ARMv6 processor running at 700Mhz with 512MB of ram. The $40.00 kit came with a Pi, power supply, acrylic case, an 8GB SD Card with [Noobs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) and HDMI cable.

I didn't initially have an idea of what I wanted to do with it. I thought after setting it up I'd find a use for it. 

Upon boot I selected the default Rasbian OS (now known as [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)) and spent 20 minutes checking out the desktop.

At the time I had already had a desktop running Linux so it wasn't a new experience for me.

In fact, I was disappointed by the slow performance of the Pi and the look and feel of Rasbian OS. It seemed more like a kids toy than a real computer.

Attempting to open the file manager or launching an app took minutes and stopped the mouse or anything else from running.
Browsing the web was a nightmare. And due to its hardware limitations I found it impossible to watch videos on YouTube.

I did some research online looking for a good use for my Pi. 

I spent a few hours setting up Retro Pi and played some single player NES and SNES games.
It worked fairly well but there were a few games that ran slowly with errors. 

After the installation of Retro Pi I used it about 3 times and once the novelty wore off it sat turned off and unused for about a year.

Then I tried connecting a 1TB drive and using it as a low-power always-on NAS. I ended up wasting 2 days researching and tinkering trying to get NextCloud to work.
When I got it working I found, yet again, the hardware was too slow to be of any practical use. 

The file transfer speeds were bottlenecked by the slow processor. At this point I was frustrated and couldn't think of a good use for the Pi. 

I turned it off and let it sit unused ever since.

## Recycled Desktop Solution
The Raspberry Pi projects listed above can be accomplished with [POP OS](https://pop.system76.com/) and an inexpensive used desktop PC.
The PC will have more power, speed, and reliability, but cost more in electricity. 

Again, Raspberry Pi single board computers are great for low-powered always-on projects. 

They are not for me because I cannot justify spending any money on a device that doesn't fit my needs.
