                <h3>Free Portfolio for Graphic Designers</h3>
                <p>Whether you are a beginner getting started or a professional who's been working for years. All Graphic Designers must have a portfolio. There are many options for setting up a portfolio.</p>
</p>                
<p>                
Make sure you are very careful with how you brand yourself. If you are not using your own name make sure the business name you choose is professional and easy to remember. Avoid strange ways of spelling names. This will make it harder for people to find you online. 
</p>                
<p> 
Below are three free options available to Arists and Graphic Designers. I recommend you look at each site for a while before deciding which one works best for you. 
</p>  
<h3>3 Free Options</h3>             
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">Deviant Art</a></li>
</ul> 
<p> 
These free options will give you a portfoilo where you can upload images of your work to share with clients or employers. They take just a few minutes to create an account and then you can start adding your work. A lot of Graphic Designer just use these free options. Which works perfectly fine. 
</p>                
<p> 
If you want your own website address and control over how your site looks you will have to spend a bit of money. Especially if you will be selling your work or services through your site. 
</p> 
<p>You will need a domain which is a techincal way of saying your website address. Again, if you are not using your own name (something I highly advise against) then make sure your business name is easy to say and spell. That way it will be easy to find online and for your clients to tell other people about your website. Word of mouth and other forms of marketing will be easier in the long run.</p>

<p>Buying a domain is easy and not very expensive. First you'll have to find a domain seller. Also known as a "Registrar". These are the companies that lease you a domain name per year. Make sure you get the privacy added to your domain. It is usually only an extra $9.00 or so a year. Otherwise some sales people will look up your contact information through your domain and try to sell you things. It is very annoying.</p> 

<h3>Registrars</h3>  
             <ul>
                 <li><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a></li>
                 <li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a></li>
                 <li><a href="https://www.1and1.com/">1&amp;1.com</a></li>
                 <li><a href="http://www.dotster.com/">Dotster.com</a></li>
             </ul>  
             
<p>Once you have a domain then you will need to get hosting. That is the server space where your website is stored so peopel can visit it. All hosting companies will help you setup your host and connect it to your domain. You will want to shop around to get the best deal.</p>         
<h3>Website Hosting</h3> 

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.hostgator.com/">HostGator</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.1and1.com/">1&amp;1.com</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/">BlueHost</a></li>
        </ul>  
        
<p>After you have everything up and running. You can then decided to either use static HTML &amp; CSS to create your website. Or, if you don't know how to write code or don't want to you can use a content management software like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. All hosting companies offer quick automated Wordpress site setup, just ask.</p> 

     <p>Once your Wordpress site is setup you can login and start posting images of your work. You can even write a blog if you choose. With a hosted site you can even install a custom <a href="http://themeforest.net/">theme</a> to make your site look unique.</p>   
  
<p>If you do like to write HTML &amp; CSS, like I do. Then you can use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Page</a> to host your website for free. Of course you will still need your own domain.</p>   
 
<p>The process for setting up a GitHub page takes more technical and coding knowlege. Like the other options it has some pros and cons. The main pro is being able to save money by using GitHub Pages as a free website host. If you can Design and Code then your site can look anyway you want. 
</p>
<p>
The two main drawback are that you have to write all your pages using static HTML &amp; CSS. Which means every post is written using code. Also, you don't get any automated features like you would with a dynamic Wordpress based website. No web forms, shopping carts, or payment systems to sell products and services. Unless you tie in 3rd party systems, which might turn off some customers.</p>
 
<p>It all depends on what kind of designer you are and what kind of portfolio you are trying to build.
 Consider all these options before you decide.</p>
