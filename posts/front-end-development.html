<h3>Front End Development</h3>
<p>Front-End Developers write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The languages browsers speak, to display what users see and interact within the browser.</p>

<p>Development, like all highly skilled disciplines, exists on a spectrum. The field of software development is too vast for any single person to know everything. It costs a lot of time, effort, and money to learn these skills.</p>

<p>As the old saying goes, "The jack of all trades is the master of none." This is why developers specialize on a single area of focus within the overall spectrum of development.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the only languages that web browsers understand natively. We use browsers everyday to check our Facebook profile, watch YouTube videos, and search for things on Google. (Google Chrome is my favorite browser)</p>

<p>Web browsers are a class of application that runs on your device (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, Smartphone) and displays web pages. When you are using your browser, in the blink of an eye, it will request a web page from a web server, download and combine the collection of HTML, CSS, JavaScript files along with any relevant images and render them as a full page for you to view and interact with.</p>

<p>These files are actually text files with the ending extensions renamed.</p>

<p>So all the complexity of the web you use everyday is created by these three limited languages. Each one has a specific purpose that works in concert with the other two to bring web pages to life.</p>

<p>For non-technical people we can consider the analogy of a house. HTML would be the floor, walls, ceiling, and roof of the house. CSS would be the layout of the rooms, the color of the carpet and walls, the placement of the windows and doors. JavaScript would be the electrical, heat and AC, and the water running into and out of the house. All of these elements are needed to make a functional modern web page.</p>

<h3>Back-End Development</h3>
<p>Back-End Development is also known as "Application Development". It is different from Front-End Development because the languages used cannot be understood or displayed by web browsers. These languages either run exclusively on the server to process data or are used to generate and deliver HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that the browser can understand. Back-End languages include: ASP, C#, .Net, PHP, Ruby, Python, and Java. Some of these languages must be compiled by special expensive tools like Visual Studio before they can be run on the server.
</p>

<p>
In large web applications like Facebook or Amazon, data is stored in a database. Think of a database like a secure vault that holds lots of linked together spreadsheets. This is where all the secure information, like user information, or Facebook posts, is held.</p>

<p>Back-End Developers link the front-end code using application languages like PHP to databases like MySQL, SQL, and Oracle. Some Back-End Developers specialize in database design and development.</p>

<p>Back-End Development is even more complex and time consuming to learn than Front-End Development. That's why Back-End Developers usually earn 50% to 70% more money.
There are rare developers who can do both Front-End and Back-End Development. They are called "Full Stack" developers. Like Unicorns they are extremely rare. Usually these people end up in high paying jobs or they start their own business. You will likely never see a true Full-Stack Developer without a job and/or business of their own.</p>

<h3>How long does it take to learn Front-End Development?</h3>
<p>In the last five years Front-End Development has exploded into a very complex array of tools, frameworks, and libraries all aimed at making it easier to write and organize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to make fast, interactive, and advanced web applications.</p>

<p>These languages take time to learn. Just like if you tried to learn to read and speak a foreign language. Learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can take a year or longer.
Then you have to learn revisioning tools like Git. CSS preprocessors like LESS and SCSS. JavaScript preprocessors like CoffeeScript or TypeScript. Build tools like Grunt, Gulp, and WebPack. Package management tools like Bower. Responsive frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, and Skeleton. Single-Page Application frameworks (SPA) like Angular, Ember, and Meteor.</p>

<p>Putting it all together it will take at least four years of study and practice to be functional. That's the same amount of time as a college degree. Plus, these technologies are a moving target that change daily. While learning these skills you must stay updated on the newest trends and latest advancements just to stay relevant. Otherwise you'll be left in the dust.</p>

<p>Here's a short list of some of the popular (at the time of this post) front-end frameworks and tools available.</p>

<p>Like I said before, learning Front-End Development is very much like learning to read, write, and speak a foreign language. It will take consistent study and practice to develop professional level skills.</p>
