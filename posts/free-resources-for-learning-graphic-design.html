                <h3>Free Resources for Learning Graphic Design</h3>
                <p>You do not have to go to college or design school to be a graphic designer. </p>
</p>                
<p>                
I'll say it again. Most clients and employers <span class="attention">do not care</span> if you have a degree from a fancy school. All they care about is if you have the skills and you can do the work.
</p>                
<p> 
All a degree shows, is that you can follow rules and pass tests. What it doesn't show is that you can manage your time while creatively solving problems. Can you deal with co-workers and clients effectively while still getting the work done? How can you show potential clients and employers that they should hire you?
</p>                
<p> 
The answer is you must have an online portfolio of work. Along with a decent resume.
</p>                
<p> 
Of course if you're new to Graphic Design you won't have any client work to post. This means you'll need to create a dozen or more Logos, Icons, Infographics, and Website mockups.
</p>                
<p> 
You can pick existing items and redesign them or use your imagination and come up with your own designs. Either way, you'll want to show that you have a range of skills through your portfolio.
</p>                
<p> 
Below is a set of resources that will help you develop your skills.
</p>                
<p>  

<h2>YOUTUBE VIDEOS</h2>               
<p>
I love learning from watching videos. Some of the "How-To" videos on YouTube rival those of college and paid for online training courses. You'll have to invest some time searching through YouTube to find the diamonds in the rough. I've complied a short list of my favorites to get you started. 
</p>  
              
<h3>TastyTuts Creative tutorials by Gareth David</h3>

<h3>Roberto Blake</h3>
                
<p> 
Roberto Blake is another YouTube Graphic Designer who focuses  on providing  information for other freelancers and entrepreneurs. His videos are a bit more advanced. So you'll want to ground yourself in the basics of Graphic Design first. </p>

</ul>


<h3>Websites</h3>
              
<p>
There are some great websites that will give you free information and resources to help you learn the skills of being a Graphic Designer. Keep in mind you'll want to check post dates to make sure the information you're getting is as updated as possible.  Anything posted within the last 3 years is going to be relevant and helpful. Older posts and even historical texts about Graphic Design will help you develop a better foundation of knowledge.
</p>                
<p>
In my opinion, developing practical marketable skills should come first. If you are trying to get a job working for a company. Spend your time wisely learning what employer's in your area are looking for. Then focus on learning and/or improving those skills as quickly as possible. If you plan on only freelancing  this step will still be helpful. You'll learn what skills are the most in demand in your area.
 </p>                
<p> 
You can start your research by going to the top employment sites, Dice, Monster, CareerBuilder, and LinkedIn. Search for Graphic Design Jobs in your area. Take notes on the what the employers want you to know. Of course you'll need to know Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. Those are the industry standard software all Graphic Designers should know how to use. 
</p>                
<p>
What you'll need to be aware of is what they want you to do and what restrictions you'll be working under. What will your daily workload look like? What other skills, both Graphic Design and non-Graphic Design, will they expect from you? Will you be given time to work on one project at a time or will you be expected to multitask? Will you have the chance to focus and flow or will there be constant interruptions? This is where picking the right company culture comes into play.

<h3>BOOKS</h3>
               
<p>
You can Google "Top Books for Graphic Designers" and you'll get a huge list of books to look at.
</p>                
<p>
Here's a few sites I found with lists I liked. I've only read a handful of these books. Clearly the more you read the better. You'll notice some of the books on these lists are repeated. Those are the key books to read.

</p>                
<p>
As you can see the topic of Graphic Design is huge. There are so many different types of design with different styles and perspectives. It really can get overwhelming if you get too caught up in trying to amass all the information before you start.
</p>                
<p>
The information above will keep you busy for a long time. Pick one video, site, or book and work through it completely before moving on to the next thing. Your best option is to look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYfCBK8IplO4E2sXtdKMVpKJZRBEoMvpn">YouTube Beginner's guide to Graphic Design</a> by Gareth David. He covers all of this, in simple to understand short videos. Along with links for further reading.
