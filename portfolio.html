<h2 class="blog-post-title">Responsive Email</h2>
<div class="portfolio-image">
<img src="portfolio/demandlab/inside-tweaks-template.png" class="img-responsive">
</div>

<p>I landed a short contract working remotely for a small marketing company called DemandLab. They wanted my help setting up responsive emails and landing pages. They use Marketo and Wordpress as their software platforms.</p>
<p>Responsive HTML emails are strange. Built using HTML tables, no head, and limited inline styles. It is the height of inefficient development.</p>
<p>I was given a handful of responsive HTML emails to add content to and prepare for review. As well as a couple of responsive HTML email templates that needed to be setup so the client could use them for an ongoing newsletter.</p>

<p>I learned a lot from these projects. Email clients like Outlook, Google, Yahoo, and Mac Mail vary widely in their HTML email rendering capabilities. What you can create is severely limited. They all seem to be technologically stuck in 2006. </p>
<p>
Why haven't any of these companies attempted to update the rendering engines within their clients? Some experts cite security concerns. In truth they don't invest in upgrading because there is little financial gain.</p>
<div class="portfolio-image">
<img src="portfolio/demandlab/tweaks-template.png" class="img-responsive">
</div>

<p>Learning responsive HTML also helped me learn more about marketing which I really enjoyed.</p>
<p>The main take away from building out responsive emails is understanding the tools and technologies being used before starting. Knowing that margins and padding do not work and you will be forced to use HTML table cell spacing and kludge techinques is both helpful and dishearting.</p>
<p>Working with responive HTML emails has given me a new appreciation for modern browers and their capabilities.</p>
<div class="portfolio-image">
<img src="portfolio/demandlab/demandlab-wordpress.png" class="img-responsive">
<p>Aside from the responsive HTML emails. I was also tasked with setting up landing pages within their Wordpress install. This was much more in my wheel house so it took much less time.</p>

<p>The contract ended abruptly so I didn't save any of the code I wrote to my Github.</p>

<h2 class="blog-post-title">HCCMIS Side Projects</h2>
<div class="portfolio-image">
<img src="portfolio/hccmis-redesign/atlas-golf.png" class="img-responsive">
</div> 

<p>I finished the templates for the HCCMIS Redesign. They liked my work so much they extended my contract to work on a few side projects.</p>
<p>They needed my help making pages responsive. Instead of using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, which I most familiar with, I was directed to use <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a>. This is a similar responsive framework. However, it is significantly smaller in terms of CSS code and options. It is a single fluid grid with a handful of helper classes. Everything else you must write yourself from scratch.</p>

<p>The main reason to use responsive frameworks like Bootstrap is to speed up development time. In my opinion, Skeleton works best for smaller landing pages or tiny websites. Anything larger or that requires more functionally should be developed with a more robust responsive framework. In this case the manager told me to use Skeleton for these side projects because he didn't know or like Bootstrap.</p>

<div class="portfolio-image">
<img src="portfolio/hccmis-redesign/atlas-travel.png" class="img-responsive">
</div> 

<p>I had not heard of or used Skeleton before this. My lack of familiarity slowed me down. It took me a few days to wrap my mind around how to best implement the Skeleton grid. The documentation on the Skeleton website is sparse and makes a lot of unspoken assumptions regarding how it works.</p>

<p>After a bit of trial and error I found it best to build my media queries based on min-widths. This meant starting from mobile-sized displays and working my way up to larger screens. This is also known as <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement" target="_blank">"Progressive Enhancement"</a>.</p>

<div class="portfolio-image">
<img src="portfolio/hccmis-redesign/client-zone.png" class="img-responsive">
</div> 

<p>These small projects varied widely in scope and depth. Generally I was making the pages responsive and adding extras based on what the projects called for.</p>

<p>Because these projects were very small and based on simple Skeleton grids there was no point in adding the code to my Github. </p>

</div>  

<p>I was hired on contract to help <a href="http://www.hccmis.com/" target="_blank">HCC Medical Insurance Services</a> with their website redesign.</p>

<p>My job was to take the layered Photoshop PSD images created by the graphic designer and use them as a guide to create responsive web page templates in HTML and CSS code. I used Bootstrap to make the pages responsive.</p>

<p>The marketing deparment used PHP and Cascade Server for the backend. That meant I could do all my work in static HTML and CSS. With just a little JavaScript and jQuery for menus and other minor page effects.</p>

<p>I only had to make a few base pages that would then be added to the Cascade Server and cloned for all the other pages for the site.</p>

<p>This project took a little over three months to complete. It pushed me to learn and improve my skills in responsive development.</p>
<p>You can view the code I wrote on my Github.</p>

                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Wordpress Transfers</h2>
<div class="portfolio-image">
<img src="portfolio/celadon-trucking/hoss.png" class="img-responsive">
</div>              

<p>While I was working for <a href="http://celadontrucking.com/cms400min/celadon2013/homepage.aspx" target="_blank">Celadon Trucking</a> they aquired a handful of smaller trucking companies. These smaller trucking companies all used Wordpress for their websites.</p>

<p>The IT Department was tasked with finding a way to transfer these smaller sites over to the on-site servers because the company wasn't willing to keep paying for the Wordpress hosting.</p>

<p>Since the IT Department was a Microsoft shop the developers had no experience with LAMP Stack, CPanel, or Wordpress. They had assumed they would have to rebuild each site from scratch in ASPX, using C# for the middleware processing code, and connect it to an SQL database. Because that's the only model they knew.</p>

<p>I was told at the timeb that the companies where in the process of being folded into Celadon. Most of these sites needed to be static and would eventually be deleted.</p>

<div class="portfolio-image">
<img src="portfolio/celadon-trucking/houg.png" class="img-responsive">
</div> 

<p>I suggested not wasting months rebuilding sites that would end up getting trashed. I showed the developers how to use the free <a href="https://www.httrack.com/">HTTrack Website Copier</a> tool. To make a static copy of each site.</p>

<p>I spent 30 minutes and made copies of all the sites they needed to convert. They were impressed.</p>

<p>I told them it would only take me a day or two to clean up file structures and convert them to ASPX for hosting on the internal servers.</p>
<p>The lead developer told me I saved them hours of tedious programming and thousands of dollars.</p>
  
<p>Some of the Wordpress sites were still being used by people needing make updates. So, in those cases I asked the Server Admin to setup a sand boxed install of Wordpress on IIS and to give me Admin access to Wordpress itself.</p>

<div class="portfolio-image">
<img src="portfolio/celadon-trucking/hyndman.png" class="img-responsive">
</div>   
         <p>Once that was setup I exported the site data from the original site and then imported it into our clone. I had to spend a few hours going into the site and setting up all of the widgets to match the orginal site.</p>
         <p>Last, I copied the existing user accounts from the original site to the clone and sent emails out to those individuals.</p>
        <p>It was a bit more time-consuming than the static copy method. It produced the result the company want while saving them money.</p>
            <p>Since I didn't actually write any of the code for the sites. I have not added them to my Github account.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>This was a year long web application for a <a href="http://celadontrucking.com/cms400min/celadon2013/homepage.aspx" target="_blank">Celadon Trucking</a>. Its purpose was to create a secure responsive site that allows the drivers to access their payment information through their smart phones. The companies analytics gathered over 6 months proved that the majority of drivers were checking their settlement sheets using iPhones. </p>
         <p>The company used a Microsoft Development Back-end consisting of an IIS Server, ASPX Pages, C# middleware, SQL Databases, and an AS400 Database.</p>
         
<p>I was tasked with taking the graphic designer's page mockups and re-creating them using HTML and CSS. Because the company used Microsoft and .Net this project was considerably more frustrating and time-consuming than it should have been.</p>
         
<p>Instead of using vanilla HTML5 I had to write ASPX pages. These are similar technologies but the differences in how they operate annoyed me. CSS cannot touch ASPX controls or forms directly. These pages where mostly ASPX grids of data. There do exist ASPX attributes that can be attached to page elements in order to then add CSS classes. In my opinion Microsoft web development in general seems like a kludge configuration that hindered my progress.</p>
         
<p>I have no programming skill or experience in C# or VB. Frankly, I do not like the Microsoft stack at all. It seems over-engineered for no good reason. I will not work in that kind of environment again.</p>
         
<p>I prefer working purely on front-end using either JavaScript data binding or PHP for the middleware.</p>
         
<div class="portfolio-image">
<a href="https://github.com/starcorelabs/celadon-trucking-driver-portal" target="_blank"><img src="portfolio/celadon-trucking/2014-11-14%2008_52_01-Terminals.png" class="img-responsive"></a>
</div>
         
<p>The Senior developer worked closely with the AS400 database programmers to make sure the drivers data was secure and none of the code would break.</p>
         
<p>For my own securty I did not save any of the C# middleware code or config files. I never had access to the database since I was only working on the Front-End code. I saved only the front-end ASPX code I actually wrote for my portfolio. Without those missing files there is no way to build and run this code. I took the screenshots back while I was working for the company.</p>
<p>However, if you are curious you can view the front-end code on my Github repo.</p>

                    <p>
                    This was one of my first experiments in building a responsive page using Bootstrap.
                    </p>
                    <p><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is a CSS library used by developer to create web pages that will shrink and grow depending upon the size of the screen used to view them. This allows developer to create one set of web pages for a site and they will work on the majority of smart phones, tablets, laptops, and desktop screens.</p>
                    <p>Initially I used Bootstrap 2.3 which worked but had some quirks. Half way thorough Bootstrap updated to version 3.0 which was a major code break. So, I had to rewrite the page from scratch. This process was tedious but cemented my understanding of the Bootstrap 3 grid system.</p>
                    <p>Also, I put together the graphics for the page using Photoshop.</p>
