<h2 id="Hello-Friends"><a href="#Hello-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Hello Friends,"></a>Hello Friends,</h2><p>Many of you have been asking what I’ve been doing lately?<br>Rather than answer everyone individually I decided to write one big update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR - I have been configuring my hardware, updating my JavaScript skills, and rebuilding my website for freelancing. </p>

<h3 id="1-Zeus"><a href="#1-Zeus" class="headerlink" title="1. Zeus"></a>1. Zeus</h3><p>Lenovo ThinkStation 300P - Main Desktop</p>
<p><img src="/images/20200818_desktop.jpg" alt="Desktop"></p>
<p>In the last month I’ve switched from <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux Mint</a> to <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pop OS</a> as my desktop OS.<br>Both are great operating systems and have excellent compatibility with my hardware.<br>Linux Mint has been my favorite OS and the main one I run for the last couple years. </p>
<p>Recently I tried Pop OS and found I liked some of the new features it offers that Linux Mint lacks.<br>So I decided to switch and run it for 30 days to see if I like it. So far its great.</p>
<h3 id="Rack"><a href="#Rack" class="headerlink" title="Rack"></a>Rack</h3><p>Over 2019 I built myself a budget rack of computers to use as my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homelab</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/images/20200818_rack.jpg" alt="Rack"></p>
<p>Here’s a list of computers and what I use them for.</p>
<h3 id="2-Cronos"><a href="#2-Cronos" class="headerlink" title="2. Cronos"></a>2. Cronos</h3><p>Raspberry Pi B+ (1st Gen) - Used with Raspberry Pi lite OS. This has no Graphical User Interface. It is terminal only. </p>
<p>I SSH into it and use it for general tinkering with terminal apps.<br>There are many interesting terminal apps for linux-based systems.<br>Some I prefer to test before installing on my production machines. </p>
<h3 id="3-Apollo"><a href="#3-Apollo" class="headerlink" title="3. Apollo"></a>3. Apollo</h3><p>Lenovo M93P SFF - Nextcloud Server</p>
<img src="/images/nextcloud-logo.png" alt="Nextcloud Logo" class="nextcloud-logo">

<p>Originally, I was using it to access personal files while I was at work.<br>Since the company I was working for told us to work from home (and then later let me go during a pandemic) I’ve not needed to access it remotely.</p>
<p>Recently the DDNS I was using changed their terms of service.<br>Plus, my internet speeds keep dropping. Especially the upload speeds which affects folders and files shared with friends.<br>So I disconnected the service and removed the port forward from my router.<br>Unfortunately for the forseeable future I won’t be sharing this server anymore.</p>
<p>Instead I am encouraging those who are interested to spend 20 - 30 minutes and build their own server out of an old desktop or laptop.<br>Here’s the short video I used to build mine. Its a great self-hosted replacement for DropBox and Google Drive.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D1M5eH3PnQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting Set Up With Nextcloud - The EASY Way</a></p>
<h3 id="4-Aether"><a href="#4-Aether" class="headerlink" title="4. Aether"></a>4. Aether</h3><p>Lenovo M93P Tiny - Ubuntu Server 20.04 running an instance of Modded Minecraft.<br>I’ve been a fan of Minecraft on PC since it was released in beta. </p>
<p>Some parts of the modded version I run take a bit more resources and time.<br>So its easier to leave the world running to allow things to grow and progress while I’m doing other things.</p>
<p>This tiny computer is running a terminal only version of Ubuntu Server.<br>I’ve installed a terminal app called “Screen” which allows me to start the Minecraft server.<br>Then disconnect from it and leave it running. These are the kinds of geeky things that make me happy. </p>
<h3 id="5-Poseidon"><a href="#5-Poseidon" class="headerlink" title="5. Poseidon"></a>5. Poseidon</h3><p>Lenovo ThinkStation S30 - Media Server<br>Currently running Linux Mint 19.3 + <a href="https://jellyfin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jellyfin</a>. </p>
<p>It was running Plex for a few years. Plex is free but not open source.<br>I dislike how Plex requires an account and internet connection to run.</p>
<p>So, I switched to Jellyfin. It has a bit more of a learning curve.<br>But overall it works better for me. </p>
<p>Even when my unreliable Comcast internet decides to stop working.<br>I can still access my Movies and TV shows locally on my network. </p>
<h3 id="6-Hermes"><a href="#6-Hermes" class="headerlink" title="6. Hermes"></a>6. Hermes</h3><p>Dell Vostro 3700 Laptop - Influx Server running Pop OS.<br>This is setup with security to manage the influx of data into my homelab.<br>It monitors incoming and outgoing bits while remaining secure behind a VPN.</p>
<h3 id="7-Hades"><a href="#7-Hades" class="headerlink" title="7. Hades"></a>7. Hades</h3><p>Lenovo ThinkStation S30 - Inside an Antec P100 Case. Running Linux Mint 19.3.<br>This is my storage server. Or, overly engineered home NAS. (No Raid)</p>
<p>At one time it was running Open Media Vault.<br>I switched to Linux Mint so I could remote in and sort files locally between drives. </p>
<p>Yes, I took the guts out of an S30 and installed them inside the P100 case.<br>I did this because that case holds seven 3.5 drive bays.<br>Plus, I got an adapter to put an SSD in on of the empty optical 5.5 drive bays.<br>Allowing me to use the other seven for storage. </p>
<p>I use this as my cold storage. Turning it on only for short times to back up or retrieve files.<br>It holds a lot of outdated Windows software I’ll never run again since I’ve switched to Linux.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been planning on purging a lot of old software and files I’ll never use.<br>It is a huge project that will take time.</p>
<h3 id="8-Hydra"><a href="#8-Hydra" class="headerlink" title="8. Hydra"></a>8. Hydra</h3><p>Lenovo ThinkStation S30 - Proxmox<br>This last tower was running Proxmox as a hypervisor.<br>I use it to spin up virtual operating systems and containers for small applications.</p>
<p>I was using it to run three different flavors of Linux for testing. </p>
<p>A couple months ago I formatted it and intended to reinstall Proxmox but I’ve been busy with my current project.</p>
<h3 id="Website-Rebuild"><a href="#Website-Rebuild" class="headerlink" title="Website Rebuild"></a>Website Rebuild</h3><p><img src="/images/2020-08-19_starcore_blog.png" alt="Starcore Labs Blog"></p>
<p>As you can see the current version of <a href="http://starcorelabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stacorelabs.com</a> is a simple blog.<br>However, due to recent events (being let go from my job during a pandemic).<br>I’ve decided to rebuild my site and focus on freelancing. </p>
<p>Here’s a sneak preview at the new version in the works.</p>
<p><img src="/images/starcorelabs-sneak-preview.png" alt="Starcore Labs"></p>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="Hexo.io">Hexo.io</a> as my static site generator.<br>It has some flaws and inherent limitations that prevent me from building the site I want.<br>So I’m switching to <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a> which works better.</p>
<p>As of this post I’m about 65% complete.<br>There are a few things still needing worked on.<br>As well as minor styling tweaks to make it look good.</p>
<p>So far I’m loving the new site and can’t wait to launch it.<br>However, I am learning as I go which makes my progress slower than I’d prefer.<br>But, I’d rather take my time and do it right than rush and end up with a lot of bugs.<br>Because at some point I’ll have to fix those bugs anyway.</p>
<p>This project has taken up the majority of my time.</p>
<h3 id="Modern-JavaScript"><a href="#Modern-JavaScript" class="headerlink" title="Modern JavaScript"></a>Modern JavaScript</h3><p>Before I dive back into learning React JS. It makes sense to learn the core features of modern <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>ES6 classes</li>
<li>The new variable declaration let/const</li>
<li>Scope (local, global, lexical)</li>
<li>Recursion, closures, loops, and conditionals</li>
<li>Promises + Async / Await</li>
<li>Arrow functions</li>
<li>Spread operator</li>
<li>Destructuring assignment</li>
<li>Map, filter, and reduce</li>
<li>ES6 module system = Imports/exports</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an article I found that explains some of these concepts in more detail.<br><a href="https://dev.to/nsebhastian/javascript-basics-before-you-learn-react-38en#es6-module-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript Basics Before You Learn React</a></p>
<h3 id="React-JS-Training"><a href="#React-JS-Training" class="headerlink" title="React JS Training"></a>React JS Training</h3><p>In a previous post I talked about how I was learning <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React JS</a>.<br>I pointed out a few online resources like this video.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0&t=338s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Tutorial for Beginners</a></p>
<h5 id="React-Concepts-to-learn"><a href="#React-Concepts-to-learn" class="headerlink" title="React Concepts to learn"></a>React Concepts to learn</h5><ul>
<li>What is a React component?</li>
<li>ReactDOM rendering</li>
<li>Class vs functional components</li>
<li>JSX</li>
<li>State</li>
<li>Event handling</li>
<li>Asynchronous setState</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Refs</li>
</ul>
<p>At that time I was learning it to be more valuable to employers.<br>Since I’ve decided to freelance I’ve decided to keep learning it to use in my own projects.<br>Not because it looks good on a resume but because I actually like it. </p>
<p>That being said, it does have a steep learning curve and its taking me a little longer than I expected to pick it up.<br>But, I’m confident with enough repetitive practice it will become second nature.</p>
<p>I have a few ideas for small apps that I’d like to build.<br>Once I’ve finished my website I’ll start building and posting those projects.</p>
<h3 id="Development-Books"><a href="#Development-Books" class="headerlink" title="Development Books"></a>Development Books</h3><p><img src="/images/20200818_dev-library.jpg" alt="Dev Library"></p>
<p>I’ve acquired a small dev library.<br>While I have all of these books and more on my tablet.<br>There is something relaxing about reading actual paper books. </p>
<p>I’m planning on setting aside time to dig into these books soon.</p>
<p>So that’s the full update on what I’ve been doing and what I’m currently working on.<br>I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
