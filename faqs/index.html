        <li>
        <span class="semibold">What is Starcore Labs?</span><br/>
        Starcore Labs is a "Design as a Service" agency. Offering UX/UI and Graphic Design services to everyone. Specifically catering to Entrepreneurs and Startups.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="semibold">Is this subscription-based</span><br/>
         No. This is like a prepaid phone. You're allocating a set number of hours for the designer to work on your project. See our pricing packages for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">Do I have to sign a contract?</span><br/>
        No. By prepaing for "hours" you're automatically agreeing to our Terms of Service.
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">Are there services you do not offer?</span><br/>
        Yes, here's a list:
            <ul class="simple-list">
                <li>SEO (Search engine optimization)</li>
                <li>Marketing or Sales</li>
                <li>Writing of any kind</li>
                <li>Audio and Video Production or Editing</li>
                <li>Animation and 3D Graphics</li>
                <li>Front-end coding and Back-end Programming</li>
                <li>Technical Support</li>
                <li>Computer Hardware Repair</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">How does the process work?</span><br/>
           <ol class="simple-list">
            <li>Pick the prepaid plan that fits your project.</li>
            <li>Fill out the form and pay for the service. (Hours include design and revisions)</li>
            <li>You'll receive an email with a link to Trello.</li>
            <li>There's a tutorial on how to use Trello to add design tasks.</li>
            <li>Add one task per card to the "To Do / Revisions" bucket. </li>
            <li>Prioritize your cards from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>Your designer will move the top card to "In Progress" and work on that task until its complete. You get unlimited revisions on all tasks. Then he will move on to the next task in the list. This process will continue until the project is complete or you run out of hours.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">What payment methods do you accept?</span><br/>
        We use Stripe to accept credit card and debit card payments.
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">What do the prepaid plans cover?</span><br/>
        The prepaid plans cover the hours the designer works on tasks and revisions combined. You'll need to prioritize the tasks and revisions you want the designer to work on for the time you've purchased. 
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">What if I have a small project and/or cannot afford your pricing packages?</span><br/>
        Our focus is on delivering high-quality valuable designs. Our prepaid plans are the only options we currently offer. If they don't fit your specific needs, we might not be right for your project.
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">What happens if I run out of time before the project is finished?</span><br/>
        Your designer will evaluate your project and tell you if it can be done within the hours you've purchased. Doing their best to complete the project within the allotted hours. They will let you know when you're running low on time. At that point you have two choices:
        <ol class="simple-list">
            <li>Accept the incomplete files "as is".</li>
            <li>Prepay more hours to complete the project.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">What are your work hours?</span><br/>
        Our work hours are Monday through Friday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST. We are closed during the following holidays:
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>New Year's Eve</li>
            <li>New Year's Day</li>
            <li>Independence Day</li>
            <li>Halloween</li>
            <li>Thanksgiving Day</li>
            <li>Christmas Eve</li>
            <li>Christmas Day</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">How do I make design requests?</span><br/>
        We use Trello for design requests, task management, and to provide deliverables.
        </li>
        <li>
        <span class="semibold">What information do I need to provide for each task?</span><br/>
        Write out the result you want to accomplish. The more details like font, color, height and width of elements in pixels you can provide, the better.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="semibold">How many tasks can I request?</span><br/>
         As many tasks as you want. Your designer will work on each task one at a time until the project is complete or your prepaid time runs out. Whichever happens first. If you run out of time, you can prepay more.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="semibold">What does, “One task at a time” mean?</span><br/>
         Your designer is a human being and will work on one task at a time. In Trello, this will be the "In Progress" task. Once done it will be moved to "Review" for you to evaluate.
         If you're happy with the result you can move it to "Done". Or, you can move it to "To Do / Revisions" and add a commment explaining the changes you want made.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="semibold">How fast do tasks get completed?</span><br/>
        Tasks are completed in 1 to 5 business days, depending on the complexity of the task.
        </li>
         <li>
         <span class="semibold">What software do you use?</span><br/>
        We mainly use Figma. We do not use Adobe products due to their predatory business practices and exorbitant subscriptions. However, depending on the client's request we might use other software:
        <ul class="simple-list">
            <li>Inkscape</li>
            <li>Gimp</li>
            <li>Lunacy</li>
            <li>Drawio.com</li>
            <li>Photopea.com</li>
            <li>Pixso.net</li>
            <li>Penpot.app</li>
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="semibold">Who owns the work after it's done?</span><br/>
        Once the project is complete you own all the designs made by Starcore Labs. However, you don't own any public domain, royalty free, open source, or licensed resources that were included in your project. We only use royalty free resources in our designs unless you ask us to include something else. Keep in mind, you are legally responsible if you decide to include any licensed resources in your design. We don't have time to research and verify if you have appropriate rights to use licensed resources.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="semibold">What if I don't like the design?</span><br/>
        We offer unlimited revisions during the hours you purchased. Make a request through Trello and we'll change it until your happy, or until your hours run out. You can always prepaid more hours.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="semibold">What if I want a refund?</span><br/>
        Due to the time-consuming nature of our high-quality work, we do not offer any refunds.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span class="semibold">What if I have a question not covered here?</span><br/>
        You can send us a message through our contact form and we'll get back to you when we have time.
