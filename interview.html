                <p>I have 6 years of experience in call centers as a Tech Support Agent.</p>

                <p>During that time I taught myself Graphic Design and Front-End Development. While doing a little freelancing on the side. Eventually, I decided to change careers.</p>

                <p>I wanted to move into Design but all I could find were Front-End Development roles that were focused on <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"
                    target="_blank">CSS</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)" target="_blank">SASS</a>.</p>

                <p>For the last 3 years I've worked in large corporate environments as a UI/UX Developer with some Design mixed in.</p>

                <p class="lead">
                  I was part of a 3 person UX Development team tasked with fixing code errors in front-end views for a C# MVC web application.
                </p>
                  <p class="lead">
                    We compared the pages that were built by the offshore team against prototypes to find errors.
                  </p>
                  <p class="lead">
                    We rewrote Bootstrap HTML and CSS/SASS code to correct where the components were placed on pages. Testing with software, and visually, to make sure the views worked correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
                  </p>
                  <p class="lead">
                    After 5 months, creation of front-end views was moved from offshore to our department. This reduced the time it took for testing, bug fixing, and deployment.

              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Yes, my previous corporate positions used Agile and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" target="_blank">Scrum</a>.</li>

              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: My focus is on Design. But, I am open to doing light Front-End Development. Specifically HTML, CSS/SCSS, and Bootstrap.</li>

              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Yes, here's a link to my <a href="https://github.com/starcorelabs" target="_blank">Github</a>. But I've not added to it for a while because my focus is on design not code.
                Also bear in mind, I was not able to save my corporate projects because those jobs required me to sign an NDA.</li>

              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I am more experienced with Bootstrap. A few years ago while working in a corporate job I used <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a> for a project. Another company I worked for
                considered using <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> but decided to go with Bootstrap because that's what all the developers were familiar with.</li>

              </li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Short answer: No, I've not had the opportunity to use them. <br> Long answer: The corporate enviroments I've worked in were Microsoft shops. Projects were written in C# MVC for the backend. I wrote HTML, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, and Razor for views. We used Node and Gulp for automation of tasks on the front-end.</li>

              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What about Back-End Programming? For example: C#, .Net, PHP, Python, Ruby, or Java.</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I've worked as a Front-End Developer on a team supporting C# programmers. But I do not know C# or back-end programming. Learning to program is like learning to speak a foreign language. It takes a lot
                of time and practice. I've spent my time learning design.</li>
