<p><img src="../assets/img/sunrise-peak.png" class="img-responsive hire-img"></p>
<p>I am currently working full time as UX/UI Designer for a <a href="https://starcorelabs.com/portfolio/aventiv/">good company</a>.</p>
<p>My free time is limited so I am selective with the freelance projects I take on.<br />
I offer UX/UI Design and Graphic Design services for businesses and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><small>Note: Due to a corporate non-compete agreement I'm unable to offer my services to some businesses.</small></p>
<p>I am happy to collaborate with you to create a beautiful and easy to use solution.</p>
<p>Here's a brief overview of the services I offer and my process.</p>
<h3>Services I Offer</h3>
<ul>
<li>UX/UI Design for web, mobile, and other applications</li>
<li>Graphic Design for logos and content images for websites</li>
<li>Flowcharts for the flow of data and users through an application</li>
<li>Low-Fidelity mockups of all the screens that make up an application</li>
<li>High-Fidelity prototypes used by developers to build your application
 </li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #c0392b;">Services I DO NOT Offer</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>SEO</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Technical and/or Content Writing</li>
<li>Video Production and/or Editing</li>
<li>Application Coding and/or Programming</li>
<li>Technical Support and/or Computer Repair
 </li>
</ul>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Over the years I've developed a streamlined process to work with clients.</p>
<p>Before any agreements are made or contracts are signed I hold an informational meeting with a potiental client.
This is where they explain their product idea and goals.</p>
<p>My goal during the first meeting is to figure out if I'm the right designer for their project.
I'm also listening for indicators that they understand the services I offer and have the money to invest.
This tells me they respect my time, experience, and skills.</p>
<p>Here's the questions I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you shopped around for other Designers?</li>
<li>Am I right for your project?</li>
<li>Do you understand the services I offer?</li>
<li>Who is the target audience and what problem(s) are we solving for them?</li>
<li>What research and resource gathering have you done?</li>
<li>What is your budget for this project?</li>
<li>What is the timeframe of the project?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Follow Up Steps</h3>
<p>If I agree to take on a client we have a second meeting to hammer out the business aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>We review my contract together and clarify time frame, scope of services, mile stones, and pricing.</li>
<li>After the contract is signed and the first payment is made, then I get started.
 </li>
</ul>
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<p>I offer two pricing models for my services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project-Based Pricing</li>
<li>Value-Based Pricing</li>
</ul>
<p><small>Note: I do not offer hourly based pricing.</small></p>
<h3>Project-Based Pricing</h3>
<p>This model works best for small UX/UI projects or simple graphical assets.
This is a flat fee for the design work I do on the project.
It must be fully paid in advance before I start working.
The total price is determined by the complexity, effort, and time it takes to create assets.</p>
<h3>Value-Based Pricing</h3>
<p>This model is best for medium to large projects.
Each project is unique and so is it's value to you and your customers.</p>
<p>I start with the projected revenue this project will generate for your company and then estimate 30% of that.
Then I add on the complexity, effort, and time it takes to create those assets.
 </p>
<h3>Payments</h3>
<p>Value-Based project payments are split up into two parts. Half upfront and half upon completion of the project.</p>
<p>After full payment has been made. Then the asset files will be zipped and emailed to the client.</p>
<p><small>Note: I do not store client project files after completion.</small></p>
<p>At the moment I only accept payments through: PayPal and Square.</p>
<p>Send me an email for a free quote: <a href="mailto:starcorelabs@gmail.com">starcorelabs@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h3>No Refund Policy</h3>
<p>Due to the time consuming nature of design work I do not offer refunds for services rendered.</p>
<p>Because I cannot recover my time or lost opportunities once I've committed to a project.</p>
