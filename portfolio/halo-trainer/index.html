<h3>Freelance Project</h3>
<p>While working full-time at <a href="../hccmis">HCCMIS</a> I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgiffin/">Dan Giffin</a> from the marketing department.</p>
<p>Dan said his physical therapist Bryce Taylor was looking for someone to rebuild his website.
Bryce had invented an exercise bar and had hired a separate company to manage the sales for him.
At the time his website was not easy to update or manage. He wanted something better.</p>
<p>I told Dan I'd be willing to setup a <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> website with a Theme of his choice.
Once it was up and running he'd be able to add images and content himself.</p>
<p>I had a short meeting with Bryce. We talked about what he wanted, reviewed my contract, and settled on a price. Then he hired me.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>Bryce already owned the domain he wanted to use.
I copied all the text and images from his existing site and saved them to a folder locally.</p>
<p>He gave me access to his GoDaddy account.
I installed Wordpress, added the theme he purchased, uploaded all the assets, and copied over his content.
I added a few plugins to secure his site and monitor his SEO for posts and pages.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>His existing logo had a solid square white background.</p>
<p>This didn't look good on the new black background he wanted to use.
I used Adobe Illustrator to rebuild the logo as a transparent PNG.</p>
<p>I had to track down the original font used because he didn't know what it was.</p>
<p>When the logo was ready I added it to the home page.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Through out the process I sent Bryce progress updates.</p>
<p>The whole project took a couple of days.
Once completed Bryce started updating and managing the site on his own.</p>
