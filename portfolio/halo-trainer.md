### Freelance Project
While working full-time at [HCCMIS](../hccmis) I met [Dan Giffin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielgiffin/) from the marketing department.

Dan said his physical therapist Bryce Taylor was looking for someone to rebuild his website.
Bryce had invented an exercise bar and had hired a separate company to manage the sales for him. 
At the time his website was not easy to update or manage. He wanted something better.

I told Dan I'd be willing to setup a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) website with a Theme of his choice.
Once it was up and running he'd be able to add images and content himself.

I had a short meeting with Bryce. We talked about what he wanted, reviewed my contract, and settled on a price. Then he hired me.

### Technology
Bryce already owned the domain he wanted to use.
I copied all the text and images from his existing site and saved them to a folder locally.

He gave me access to his GoDaddy account. 
I installed Wordpress, added the theme he purchased, uploaded all the assets, and copied over his content. 
I added a few plugins to secure his site and monitor his SEO for posts and pages. 

### Design
His existing logo had a solid square white background. 

This didn't look good on the new black background he wanted to use.
I used Adobe Illustrator to rebuild the logo as a transparent PNG. 

I had to track down the original font used because he didn't know what it was.

When the logo was ready I added it to the home page.

### Conclusion
Through out the process I sent Bryce progress updates.

The whole project took a couple of days. 
Once completed Bryce started updating and managing the site on his own.
