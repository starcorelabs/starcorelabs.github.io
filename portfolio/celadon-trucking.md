UPDATE: This company no longer exists.

I received layered PSD files from the Graphic Designer. 

Using Bootstrap 3 as a base. 
I wrote responsive HTML5 and CSS3 code. 
Making pages look as close to the design as possible. 

I used Photoshop for image resizing and some asset creation. 
I also worked on three other internal company projects. 

Using Photoshop and responsive CSS code.
