                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>1. Skype Meeting</h3>
                        <p>I prefer to have a Skype meeting to get to know my client’s business and goals.</p>
                        <p>I encourage them to think of their website as a resource for their clients.</p>
                        <p>My clients come to me because they need a new website or to refresh an existing website. </p>
                        <p>Keep in mind I keep the lines of coummication open while work on client projects. Mostly through email but also through multiple brief Skype meetings.</p>

                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>2. Website Types</h3>
                        <p>I offer two types of websites.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Github Pages – These are for small static informational websites that don’t change.</li>
                            <li>Wordpress – For either small or large sites. These websites are for clients who want to easily create pages and posts. Like writing a word document or email.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>3. Service Packages</h3>
                        <p>I offer three service packages.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Hourly - $60.00 an hourly – with a minimum of 2 hours. For large websites or projects that will take longer than a week. (Comes with 6 minor revisions)</li>
                            <li>Build - $400.00 flat – For small to medium websites that are 5 pages or less. (Comes with 3 minor revisions)</li>
                            <li>Maintenance - $100.00 flat - Returning clients only. Good for fixing minor issues.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>4. Scope</h3>
                        <p>This is where we talk about what I’m actually going to build and how long it will take. I prefer to write this out in detail. I want my clients to know in clear language what I am doing for them.</p>
                        <p>This is when my client picks their package, site type, layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements. </p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>5. Contract</h3>
                        <p>Once we have agreed to the specifics of what they want. I send my client a copy of my contract with the details of what I’m going to do for them. I ask them to review it, sign it, and send me a copy with their signature. Once the contract is signed we can move forward. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>6. Resources</h3>
                        <p>After the contract is signed, but before I begin building anything, my client provides me with the required resources.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Written text copy for all pages</li>
                            <li>Their business logo</li>
                            <li>Media – images, audio, and/or video.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Note: all media must be owned by you, royalty free, and/or you have written permission from the owner to use it.</p>

                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>7. Development Build</h3>
                        <p>Once the site is complete I send a link to my client to review my work. At this point my client can ask for minor revisions if they want to.</p>
                        <p>Major design or functional changes will require a new estimate. Once my client approves the development version we can move to the next step. </p>
                        <p>Note: Revisions depend on the service package you purchased. </p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>8. Payment</h3>
                        <p>Now that my client is happy with the development version of their site.</p>
                        <p>They send the full payment, as we agreed in the contract.</p>
                        <p>After the payment shows up in my account I proceed to the next step and transfer the web site to their host and the source files to them via Dropbox.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>9. Transfer</h3>
                        <p>My client gives me access to their hosting environment.</p>
                        <p>(Github pages or Wordpress host)</p>
                        <p>
                            I then take the time to copy the site from my development server to their host and make the site live.</p>
                        <p>After the site is up and running I test it and troubleshoot any issues I find.</p>
                        <p>Once everything is working correctly I save all the source files to a zipped folder and send it to my client via Dropbox. I give my client up to 10 days to save the source files before I delete them. Either after my client lets me know they saved their files or after 10 days have passed, I delete the source files from my Drobox.
                        </p>
                        <p>I do not have the storage space to store client source files long term.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="top-space">
                        <h3>10. Remove Access</h3>
                        <p>Once the contract is complete I ask the client to either remove the temporary account they setup for me. Or, to change their password to remove my access from their host. </p>
                        <p>This improves their security by ensuring that only they have access to the admin section of their site from this point on.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div>
                        <h3>Questions?</h3>
                        <p>If you have any questions regarding this process feel free to email me. I'll be happy to answer your questions.</p>
                        <p>I usually go over all questions with my clients through Skype meetings.</p>
