<h3 id="I-Am-Not-A-Therapist"><a href="#I-Am-Not-A-Therapist" class="headerlink" title="I Am Not A Therapist"></a>I Am Not A Therapist</h3><p>I do not offer therapy of any kind. This includes listening to complaints, frustrations, or venting. </p>
<p>I refuse to be a sounding board, a stress release valve, or an emotional punching bag to help other people feel better. This only wastes my time and leaves me feeling drained.</p>
<p>I do not take on other peoples problems. Because I have my own to deal with.</p>
<p>My motto: “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/depression-management-techniques/201412/not-my-circus-not-my-monkeys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not My Circus, Not My Monkeys</a>“. </p>
<p>I also refuse to talk about religion or politics because I dislike those topics. </p>
<h3 id="Options"><a href="#Options" class="headerlink" title="Options"></a>Options</h3><p>If you feel the need to complain, vent, or talk about how other people are not living up to your subjective expectations. Please keep in mind you have options.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep doing what you’ve been doing and you’ll keep getting the same results. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Write you complaints in a journal to help you process your emotions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accept that you ONLY have control over your own words and actions. Other people are going to do what they want. Either accept them as they are. Or, if you don’t like their behavior, cut them out of your life. There is no middle road. You cannot change other people’s behavior to suit you. Don’t expect or demand that other people should respect you. Instead respect yourself by not allowing hostile users in your life. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have any form of mental or emotional issues there are many free and low-cost online services available. Here’s a link to one: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psychology Today</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Hire a licensed therapist to listen to your complaints and offer suggestions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Relationships-Ingredients"><a href="#Relationships-Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Relationships Ingredients"></a>Relationships Ingredients</h3><p>Just like a good bowl of chili is made if many different ingredients. Relationships are a combination of elements. Relationships are a two-way street. For a relationship to be positive it must be a balanced combination of ingredients that benefit both people. Otherwise one side will feel used and become resentful. Until eventually they end the relationship.</p>
<h5 id="Worldview"><a href="#Worldview" class="headerlink" title="Worldview:"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldview</a>:</h5><p>A worldview or world-view is the fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual or society encompassing the whole of the individual’s or society’s knowledge and point of view. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Broad Worldview: This is how a person sees the world and their place in it. Some people have a broad worldview. They’ve traveled interacted with many different types of people across different cultures. They’ve developed a cultured perspective on life. They are patient, accepting, and have empathy for others. They tend to solve their own problems as well as offer help to others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Narrow Worldview: They’ve lived in the same small town most of their lives. Fearful of traveling too far from home. They glorify the past as being better than the present. They lack the awareness that not everyone shares their limited worldview. They think people they know owes them something. And, should live up to their subjective emotional expectations. They tend to be self-absorbed or self-centered. They tend to complain a lot without much effect. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Mindset"><a href="#Mindset" class="headerlink" title="Mindset:"></a>Mindset:</h5><p>There are two different mindsets people can have. Either a Fixed Mindset or a Growth Mindset. Click here to learn more about: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGvR_0mNpWM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mindset</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fixed Mindset: These people assume they have learned all they need to know. They are stuck mentally and emotionally in the past. They refused to listen, change, or grow. They absolutely will not alter their thinking or behavior unless they have no other choice. They see learning as a boring chore.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Growth Mindset: Always curious, always interested in learning new things, improving old skills and growing as a person. Requires the maturity to make mistakes, be wrong, and ask for help. Learning is seen as an exciting adventure. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Lifestyle"><a href="#Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="Lifestyle:"></a>Lifestyle:</h5><p>This is related to habits. This includes smoking, drinking, drugs, caffeine, and sugar. Some people like these things while others void them.</p>
<h5 id="Interests"><a href="#Interests" class="headerlink" title="Interests:"></a>Interests:</h5><p>Do they like Movies, TV Shows, Music, Video Games, Books, Outdoor Activities. How do they like to spend their free time when they are not working?</p>
<h5 id="Belief-or-Disbelief"><a href="#Belief-or-Disbelief" class="headerlink" title="Belief or Disbelief:"></a>Belief or Disbelief:</h5><p>Do they believe in the Easter Bunny, Santa, or the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Do they lack believe in unproven invisible beings? Can you accept people who believe or lack belief?</p>
<h5 id="Politics"><a href="#Politics" class="headerlink" title="Politics:"></a>Politics:</h5><p>Some are well informed and understand the complexities of local, national, and world politics. </p>
<p>While most are arm-chair theories at best. With little to no political education. They support whatever illogical emotionally charged sound bite crosses their path. </p>
<p>As long as it supports their narrow worldview and fixed mindset. </p>
<p>Others are more aware of their lack of political knowledge and take more time to research. Instead of jumping on a bandwagon. </p>
<h5 id="Non-Political"><a href="#Non-Political" class="headerlink" title="Non-Political:"></a>Non-Political:</h5><p>Of course there are rare individuals who recognize the futility of arguing about politics. They know only large corporations with billions of dollars can buy politicians to change laws. </p>
<p>Individual citizens neither have the money nor the influence to effect change. </p>
<p>The rich in power are going to do whatever they want. So why waste time complaining or arguing? </p>
