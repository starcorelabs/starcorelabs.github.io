	<h3>Notice</h3>
	<p>
	The Ruby Challenge has a new home page. <a href="http://rubychallenge.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://rubychallenge.wordpress.com</a>. Please update your links. This is page is the original <a href="http://starcorelabs.com" target="_blank">Starcore Labs</a> design. <br> 
	For more information read the history below.

	<h3>History</h3>
		<p>The challenge started when I suggested to a co-worker named Egan that he might enjoy learning Ruby programming. I pointed him to the free site: <a href="http://tryruby.org/" target="_blank">Try Ruby</a>. He seemed excited and said he would check it out later.  
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		A few days later I was talking with another co-worker named Paul who said he was learning Ruby because a supervisor named Corey had mentioned he and Egan had challenged each other to see who could learn it faster. They had inspired Paul to join their friendly competition learning to program Ruby. Paul had previous experience in JavaScript so he took to Ruby quickly. 
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		I was shocked to hear how quickly this suggestion of mine had taken off. Since I enjoy building web pages I took the opportunity to design a web page. Based on what Egan and Corey had decided I wrote out the rules of the challenge. Then later I setup a form where they could submit a link to their code hosted on <a href="http://pastebin.com/" target="_blank">Pastebin</a>.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		That way at the end of the challenge they could vote on each other's code. They all had predictions on who would win the first challenge. I was happy they liked the page I designed as the hub for their challenge. However, we all quickly realized that Ruby has limits and cannot directly add a digital clock to a web page. 
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		I changed the rules to say that anyone can join and you can use any extra coding language you might know. Since the main goal of the challenge is to learn to solve problems through programming. Being able to understand and explain your code is essential. 
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		Paul won the first challenge since he was the only one to submit working code. He used Ruby to put a JavaScript clock in a web page.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		Since I had created the page to organize the rules and host the challenge the natural assumption was that I would create the next challenge. Since I'm more of a UI/UX web designer with limited Ruby coding knowledge I had to do some research. I decided to create a new challenge to have them sort an Array of Words. At this point more people were hearing the buzz about the Ruby Challenge and they started joining in. 
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		Ruby Challenge had transformed from an excuse for me to design a page into a full-blown project that I was now managing. Which is not what I wanted. I enjoy designing sites and laying out user interfaces. I never wanted to manage a project like this. Especially since I'm not a Ruby Programmer. 
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		As the sorting challenge drew to a close I emailed everyone with a request for one of the them to take over running the challenge. I had other design projects I needed to deal with and managing the challenge was not my focus. 
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>
		Thankfully Corey took over the challenge. I helped him setup a new home for the site at <a href="http://rubychallenge.wordpress.com" target="_blank">http://rubychallenge.wordpress.com</a>.
		Once it was all setup he took over managing the Ruby Challenge. I keep this page as part of my portfolio of work I've done. You can see more of my work on my site: <a href="http://starcorelabs.com" target="_blank">Starcore Labs</a>.
