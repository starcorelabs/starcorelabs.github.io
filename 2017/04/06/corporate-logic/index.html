<p>Corporations are notorious for being hierarchical, authoritarian, and rigid with policies and procedures. Due to the legal requirements of doing business some of these measures are necessary.</p>
<p>The majority of the rules in corporations make no logical sense, ends up creating more work, and hinder productivity. They do things this way mainly for power and control over their employees.</p>
<p>Some companies have used a <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20110401/jason-fried-why-i-run-a-flat-company.html" target="_blank" rel="external">flat hierarchy</a> instead of the traditional top-down model. The evidence from these enterprises shows it improves speed, reduces stress, increases productivity, and profit. Why aren’t more corporations doing things this way? They are: <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20110401/jason-fried-why-i-run-a-flat-company.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Flat is the new up</a>.</p>
<p>Corporate logic is not based on actual logic. It is based on ego and whim. Disguised as “Business Needs”, which is code for “The person at the top said we have to do things this way”. It is the old Golden Rule, “He who has the gold, makes the rules”.</p>
<p>To contrast corporate logic against actual logic here’s an example. Imagine you need to go to the store to stock up on a few items: </p>
<ul>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Bread</li>
<li>Hamburger</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Strawberries</li>
<li>Burritos</li>
<li>Ham</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>The normal process is to check your kitchen to see what you are out of, or low on. You write the list out and check to see if you can afford everything. After work or during the weekend you go to the store and buy these items. Then you come home and put everything away.</p>
<p>If you have a large family you might have to increase the quantity of what to buy. Or, some members may ask for specific items, but the overall process is the same.</p>
<p>If we asked a typical Corporation to perform this same task, here’s how they would handle it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s the corporate power structure for Illogic Inc:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boss - Bill</li>
<li>Executives - Sandy, Kate</li>
<li>Managers - Debbie, Andy</li>
<li>Workers - Tom, John, Randy, Rick, Jill, Mary</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The Boss starts the process by sending an email to his Executives.<br>Here’s a two-week calendar showing the sequence of events.</p>
<p><img src="/img/two-weeks.png" alt="meeting"></p>
<p>Here’s the email from the Boss:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">To: Sandy, Kate</div><div class="line">From: Bill</div><div class="line">Subject: List</div><div class="line">Content:</div><div class="line">Hey,</div><div class="line">I think we are getting low on some things.</div><div class="line">Please work with the team to figure out what we need and restock supplies.</div><div class="line">Thanks, Bill</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Neither of the Executives know what needs to be on the list. Due to the corporate law of “Keeping up Appearances” they cannot directly ask what was on the last list. Due to fear of looking like they don’t already know.</p>
<p>In the corporate world, any lack of knowledge or skill is seen as a weakness. Being Executives they must at all times maintain the impression they know what is going on. If they don’t know something, it is the same as saying they cannot do their job. This might cause them to lose authority over those under them. Or if the boss gets the impression they cannot do their job, he might replace or fire them.</p>
<p><em>(Note: This is corporate logic and not true. Humans are flawed and make mistakes. No one can know everything or be good at everything. Yet, this is how a lot of Corporations operate.)</em></p>
<p>They decide to meet with the managers to find out if the managers know what should be on the list. But they cannot ask directly. Instead they decide to delegate the task to them so they don’t have to deal with it.</p>
<p>Here’s how the meeting goes:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div><div class="line">11</div><div class="line">12</div><div class="line">13</div><div class="line">14</div><div class="line">15</div><div class="line">16</div><div class="line">17</div><div class="line">18</div><div class="line">19</div><div class="line">20</div><div class="line">21</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">Meeting: Tuesday 11:00 AM</div><div class="line">Executives: Sandy, Kate</div><div class="line">Managers: Debbie, Andy</div><div class="line">Summary: Sandy runs the meeting by asking Debbie and Andy how they are doing.

<p>The managers stay in the meeting room for a few minutes asking each other if they’ve seen this stock list before?<br>After a few minutes they realized neither of them has seen it or knows what needs to be on this list. They decide to delegate the task to the workers under them.</p>
<p>They setup a meeting with the workers on Wednesday the 4th to assign them with the task of figuring out what items need to be restocked and in what quantity.</p>
<p>The meeting goes pretty much like the last one. Except one of the workers, Rick, asks “Can we see the last list to get an idea of what should be on the new list?”</p>
<p>The managers maintain their appearance of calm authority but inside they are panicking.</p>
<p>Andy says, “That’s a good question Rick. The last list is non-relevent as business needs have changed. So the team will need to research and determine what needs to be on the new list. The deadline is next Friday the 13th at 2:00pm.”</p>
<p>The meeting ends with all of the workers confused and frustrated. They have no idea what needs to be on the list or where to start looking. All the questions they asked were answered with a similar corporate non-answer.</p>
<p>The workers spend the rest of Wednesday and all of Thursday scouring the corporate network and internal resources looking for clues as to what needs to be on the list. A few quiet arguments between workers break out. Resulting in lost time, addtional frustration, and strained working relations.</p>
<p>Friday comes and the Managers have a review meeting to assess what the workers have found.<br>Jill hands the Managers a printed list and tells them it was a team effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Bread</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Strawberries</li>
<li>Ham</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
</ul>
<p>The Managers ask if they have verfied and validated the items on the list.<br>Randy says they looked through old purchase receipts to piece together the list.</p>
<p>The team talks about their research efforts for about 10 minutes. The Managers say they will run the list up the chain to see if it gets approved.</p>
<p>The meeting ends and the Managers feel better. But the workers are emotionally exausted and frustrated.<br>Looming over their heads is the possiblity the list won’t get approved. Which means they will have to keep working on this frustrating and poorly defined task.</p>
<p>Monday morning the 9th at 8:00 AM the Boss sends the Executives this email:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">To: Sandy, Kate</div><div class="line">From: Bill</div><div class="line">Subject: List Update</div><div class="line">Content:</div><div class="line">Hey,</div><div class="line">Please add Bacon to the list.</div><div class="line">We don&apos;t need much but I&apos;d like to have it for breakfast in the morning.</div><div class="line">Thanks,</div><div class="line">Bill</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The Executives acknowledge the email and schedule another meeting on Tuesday the 10th at 11:00 AM with the Managers.</p>
<p>They could have added to the list themselves but they are busy with other projects. (Mostly they are talking with each other and checking Facebook)</p>
<p>In the next meeting the Executives tell the Managers that everything is going well but the boss is requesting the addition of Bacon to the list.</p>
<p>The Managers check the budget for this project and say they cannot afford to add Bacon unless they remove something from the list.</p>
<p>The Executives remind the Managers the deadline for this project is on Friday the 13th. They encourage the Managers to have their team work the problem. The Managers are frustrated but are ulimately forced to comply with this last minute change.</p>
<p>They setup another meeting with their team on Wednesday at 10:00 AM. They tell the workers the Boss has requested that they add Bacon to the list. However, the budget and deadline have not changed. So they have until Friday the 13th at 2:00 PM to find a way add Bacon.</p>
<p>The Managers suggest replacing something on the list with Bacon.</p>
<p>The meeting ends with the workers feeling angry and stressed from the time-pressure because the project changed at the last minute.</p>
<p>The workers are swamped with other projects for the rest of Wednesday. They set aside Thursday to focus on finishing the list project.</p>
<p>Mostly they spend the day arguing amongst themselves as to which item should be replaced with Bacon. Tom asks if they can use Turkey Bacon instead of regular Bacon? Everyone gets upset with Tom because that’s one more option they do not have time to consider.</p>
<p>At the end of the day on Thursday they finally agree to replace Ham with Bacon because they are both pork products and about the same price. Mostly, everyone on the team is tired of this project and wants to get back to the other projects they were working on before this one was dropped on them.</p>
<p>Friday comes and everyone is in a better mood. The Boss takes the day off because he can. The Executives take a long two hour lunch and waste time talking about non-work related things. Nothing really gets done on Friday.</p>
<p>Most of the workers are eager to know if the list will be accepted.</p>
<p>At 2:00pm the Managers and workers assemble for a final review meeting. The Managers start the meeting by asking everyone how they are doing and if they have any fun weekend plans? The workers all say they are fine and plan to spend their weekend resting. Then the managers look over the list. The workers explain the process they went through to replace ham with Bacon.</p>
<p>The Manager tell the workers they did a good job and they are pleased with the results. Mostly the Managers are distracted by Facebook and other social media during the meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting ends and the workers feel a bit of relief mixed with frustration as the list project has put them behind on other projects.</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM the Managers meet with the Executives and explain how they worked together to motivate the team to produce the list. The Executives are pleased and tell the Managers they might recieve a bonus for this project. All that is left is to send it to the Boss for final approval.</p>
<p>The Mangers and Executives spend the next 20 minutes joking and talking about their plans for the weekend.</p>
<p>Sandy emails the final list to Bill.</p>

<p>Bill gets the email on his phone and replies:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div><div class="line">6</div><div class="line">7</div><div class="line">8</div><div class="line">9</div><div class="line">10</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">To: Sandy</div><div class="line">From: Bill</div><div class="line">Subject: Re: Final List</div><div class="line">Content:</div><div class="line">Sandy,</div><div class="line">I had completely forgotten about this project.</div><div class="line">The list looks good.

<p>Corporations are run by whim and ego within the confines of a top-down authoritarian hierarchy.<br>This is how time wasting and frustration inducing projects get created in the first place.</p>
<p>The project meant very little to the Boss. He completely forgot about it. It was the Executives and Managers who assumed it was importiant. Hoping if they did a good job the Boss would reward them with a Bonus. Causing the workers stress, frustration, and conflict.</p>
<p>You could replace this list with any number of projects: Magazine cover layout, Database, Or Website. The process here at Illogic Inc would still be the same.</p>
<p>Culture in any organization is created by its structure and the people who work their.</p>
<p>In this situation the Boss could have saved everyone time and pain. All he had to do was clearly define what he wanted and whom he wanted to do it. Something like list of items, that includes Bacon by the end of the day from Sandy. That would have forced her to do actual work.</p>
<p>Next time you find yourself in a crazy project that doesn’t make sense. Ask who started the project and why? Try to talk directly to that person and find out what exactly they want.</p>
<p>If you accomplish this feat of clearing up communication. You’ll be surprised to find that usually the creator of the project doesn’t know what the end result should look like. If you can pin them down and sort it out, you’ll save yourself time and the company tons of money.</p>
<p>However, if you do this by going over someone with a higher rank than you. They might take offense and look for ways to get you fired or take credit for your work.</p>
<p>This is how corporate logic works.</p>
