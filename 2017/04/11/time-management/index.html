<blockquote>
<p>People have two problems in life. Knowing what they want and knowing how to get it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some mistakenly think of time managment as as single skill. Which explains why so many are bad at managing it. It is a set of interelated skills. When used together consistently, help manage time more effectively.</p>
<p>Skills of Time Managment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus</li>
<li>Goal Setting</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Prioritizing Tasks</li>
<li>Monitoring time usage</li>
<li>Follow Through</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Focus"><a href="#Focus" class="headerlink" title="Focus"></a>Focus</h3><p>Focus is the ability to pay attention in the moment to the things and/or activities that you are doing. Focus requires ignoring distractions (Friends, TV, Facebook, Games, etc). Stay on task and accomplishing one thing at a time. Humans are biologically wired to focus on one task at a time. (unless diagnosed with ADHD. That condition requires medication for this reason)</p>
<p>To manage time better the myth of “Mulit-Tasking” must be put to rest. Try this quick exercise to demonstrate how mulit-tasking actually wastes time. At the top of a standard sheet of paper write, first and last name. Underneath it, write out numbers counting each letter in first and last names.</p>
<p><img src="/img/mulit-tasking-test.png" alt="Mulit-Tasking Test"></p>
<p>This as a template. Use a timer, there are many available for smart phones. The exercise is to time how long it takes writing words and numbers. This is not a race. Write at a normal rate. Stop the timer and save the value next to it. This is the control case of doing one task at a time.</p>
<p>Now for the mulit-task case. Start the timer and write one letter and then switch to writing a number below it. Alternate between writing letters and numbers until you finish. Stop the timer and record the results. You’ll notice is it much slower. This because we learn at an early age to focus on writing one word at a time. Switching between letters and numbers changes channels in the brain. This causes confusion by dividing focus. Anything that divides focus causes stress, frustration, wasted time, and effort. Mulit-Tasking is the worst myth perpetuated on mondern socieity by corporations. Do not do it.</p>
<p>Companies that pay hourly are especially prone to this line of thinking. They squeeze employees to get as much work out of them per hour as possible. Chasing the clock only increases stress and burnout.  </p>
<h3 id="Goal-Setting"><a href="#Goal-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Goal Setting"></a>Goal Setting</h3><p>A goal is simply a statement of a desired result. Start with the end in mind. What does it look like?<br>Create a clear picture of the outcome required. Write it down.</p>
<p>When working in a group it is essential that all team members commuicate the end result of a task as clearly as possible. Any confusion or vague discriptions waste time. Team members must go back and forth asking questions to clarify the task before it can be completed.</p>
<p>Understand how to break large projects down into smaller bit-sized chucks that be can accomplished in 30 minutes or less. Average human attention span is 30 to 40 minutes. Frequent shrot breaks help reset the brain and maximize effecitive productivity. Insitituions that do not commuicate, manage time, or plan well will cause employees to divide their attention. Again, divided attention wastes time, causes mistakes, stress, frustration, and burnout.</p>
<h3 id="Planning"><a href="#Planning" class="headerlink" title="Planning"></a>Planning</h3><blockquote>
<p>Those who fail to plan, are planning to fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Planning is the skill of using a Calendar to schedule tasks with deadlines over days, weeks, and months. As stated before, some tasks will be too large to accomplish in one 30 minute work block, or even one day. Instead create a project with a clearly defined outcome. Break down the larger vision into smaller tasks. Schedule these tasks logically so they build on each other over time. Space tasks out to give room for unforseen errors, delays, and necessary breaks. People are not machines.</p>
<p>While planning, remember to schedule time for reviewing the plan weekly and making updates as things change.</p>
<h3 id="Prioritizing-Tasks"><a href="#Prioritizing-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Prioritizing Tasks"></a>Prioritizing Tasks</h3><p>During planning consider which tasks will have the most impact and/or can be completed quickly. Prioritze those task by moving them to the top of the list or scheduling them first. Doing this ensures they get completed first. This maximizes efficent use of time as more complex task will require more time to complete.</p>
<h3 id="Monitoring-time-usage"><a href="#Monitoring-time-usage" class="headerlink" title="Monitoring time usage"></a>Monitoring time usage</h3><p>This is the most difficult aspect of time managment. Once the goals have been set and tasks scheduled it is time to work each task in the list. While working on each task it is importiant to stay aware time useage. Either adjusting working speed or revising estimates of how long each task will take to complete.</p>
<p>Take notes after each task to denote its completion and its duration.  Consistent monitoring and note taking develops a better sense of time estimation and task managment.</p>
<h3 id="Follow-Through"><a href="#Follow-Through" class="headerlink" title="Follow Through"></a>Follow Through</h3><p>Get to work as soon as possible. Without follow through, nothing gets done.</p>
<p>Don’t get stuck in “Analysis paralysis” or “Planning-itus”. Wasting time on deciding what tasks to be done and/or planning things out perfectly is counter-productive. No plan or task can be perfect. Instead aim for simple clear communication and understanding the desired outcome.</p>
<p>The point of time management is to get things done. Don’t waste time adding more busy work.<br>When working solo many of these steps can be combined, condensed, and streamlined.</p>
<p>When working in a group it is recommended to clearly define the terms, process, and proceedures for time managment before work begins.<br>Making sure to emphasize clear simple communiation between members. Nothing kills productivity faster than two or more people using the same words while assigning different meanings.</p>
<p>This a general system that can be adapted to suit most people.</p>
