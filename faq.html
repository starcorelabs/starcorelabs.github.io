              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: How are you?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I’m great thanks for asking.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What city are you in? Are you willing to relocate?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I live in Indianapolis. I am willing to relocate if the role is full time with benefits and the company pays for relocation.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Tell me about your background?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Back in 2004 I taught myself Photoshop. I used it to create graphics for local bands. Not long after that I taught myself HTML and CSS which I used to create static websites. In 2007 I went to a vocational school to learn how to build and repair computers. After graduating I worked as a tech support agent in call centers for a few years while freelancing on the side. I got tired of working in tech support and decided to jump the fence and move into design as my main profession.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What is your career focus?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: My goal is to find a UX Design role where I can create wireframes and prototypes for web applications. I've had some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development" target="_blank">Front-End Development</a> roles in the past. They were <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" target="_blank">CSS</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)" target="_blank">SASS</a> focused.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Where did you learn your skills?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I’m entirely self taught. I learned from books, online video courses, hands-on experiments, and while working in corporate environments.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What design software do you use?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, Balsamiq, Gimp, Inkscape, Figma, and sometimes I'll sketch designs on paper.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Was your last job contract or direct hire?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: My last few jobs were contract due to what was available at the time.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Why did you leave your last position(s)?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: The contract ended.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What did you do in your last role?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I was part of a 3 person UX team that was tasked with fixing code errors in front-end pages for a C# MVC web application. We compared the pages that were built by the offshore team against prototypes to
                find errors. We rewrote Bootstrap HTML and CSS/SASS code to correct where the components were placed on pages. Testing with software, and visually, to make sure the pages worked correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What freelance projects have you worked on?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I've designed logos, created cover art for bands, made graphics for marketing and social media. As well as setup and customized Wordpress websites for clients.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Your last few roles were in development but you call yourself a designer?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Yes, I took what was available. Most of my past roles were a mix of front-end development with some design.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Are you opposed to doing development?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: My focus is on UX Design. But, I am open to doing Front-End Development. Specifically HTML, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Have you used other responsive frameworks besides <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I am more experienced with Bootstrap. A few years ago while working in a corporate job I used <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a> for a project. Another company I worked for considered using <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> but decided to go with Bootstrap because that's what all the developers were familiar with.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Do you know any JavaScript frameworks? Examples: React, Angular, Vue, Backbone, Underscore, or <a href="https://javascriptreport.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-frameworks/" target="_blank">Something Else</a></li></li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Short answer: No, I've not had the opportunity to use them. <br>
                Long answer: The corporate enviroments I've worked in were Microsoft shops. Projects were written in C# MVC for the backend. I wrote HTML, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, and Razor for views. We used Node and Gulp for automation of tasks on the front-end.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Have you done any native app development for Android or iPhone?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: No, its all front-end web development experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What is your strongest development skill?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I'm great with CSS/SASS. Its like designing with code.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What about Back-End Programming? For example: C#, .Net, PHP, Python, Ruby, or Java.</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I've worked as a Front-End Developer on a team supporting C# programmers. But I do not know C# or back-end programming. Learning to program is like learning to speak a foreign language. It takes a lot of time and practice. I've spent my time learning design.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Have you written code for Databases? Exampes: SQL, MySQL, or Oracle</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: No, my experience has been on design and front-end developement. Databases are on the opposite end of the spectrum from my skill set.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Your resume seems short. Is this it, or is there more?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: You can see my full employment history on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/starcorelabs/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile. I’ve focused my resume on my design skills and kept it simple to fit on one page.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Looking at your resume your last job was some time ago. Have you been looking?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I am actively looking for a job. I’m confident the right role is out there if I keep looking.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: So are you available immediately?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Yes, I am available immediately.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What platform are you most comfortable with Mac or Windows?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I am familiar with Windows, Mac, and Linux. But, I prefer Windows.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What is your target salary?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Depending on the requirements of the position my range is $60K to $75K.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Thank you for your time. Hope you have a good day.</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Thanks. Have a great day!</li>
