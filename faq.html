            As a designer I've trained myself to look for patterns. Over the last year I've spoken with over a hundred recuiters and noticed the same repeated questions. I decided to create this F.A.Q. to save everyone time and effort.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">Before you say anything. Keep in mind, I've read all the articles that advise <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2018/08/20/8-things-never-say-tech-recruiter/" target="_blank">what you shouldn't say to recuriters</a>. I disagree with this toxic high-school mentality. I believe in order to find the right job for me, honesty is the best policy.</p>
          <p class="lead">
            If you have a question that is not on the list below, email me and I'll answer it.

            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: How are you?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I’m great thanks for asking.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Tell me about your background?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Back in 2004 I taught myself Photoshop. I used it to create graphics for local bands and their Myspace pages. In 2007 I went to a vocational school to learn how to build and repair computers. After graduating
                I worked as a tech support agent in call centers for a few years. While doing freelance design on the side. I got tired of working in tech support and decided to jump the fence and move into design as my main profession.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What is your career focus?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: My goal is to find a pure UX Design and/or Graphic Design role. While I've had some front-end development roles in the past. They were mostly CSS/SASS focused.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Where did you learn your design skills?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I’m entirely self taught. I learned from books, online video courses, and hands-on experiments.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What design software do you use?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, Balsamiq, Gimp, Inkscape, Figma, and sometimes I'll sketch designs on paper.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Was your last job contract or full time?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Most of my roles were contract due to what was available at the time. I prefer direct hire. I understand some companies want to test new talent before bringing them onboard.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What did you do in your last role?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I was part of a 3 person UX team that was tasked with fixing code errors in front-end pages for an MVC web application. We compared the pages that were built by the offshore team against prototypes to
                find errors. We worked with Bootstrap and rewrote HTML and CSS/SASS code to correct where the components were placed on pages. Checking visually, and with software tools, to make sure the pages worked correctly on desktop and mobile devices.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: You said you've freelanced in the past. What projects have you worked on?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I've designed logos, created cover art for bands, made graphics for marketing, and social media. I've even helped setup Wordpress websites for some clients.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Your last few jobs were in development but you call yourself a designer?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Yes, I’ve had to take what was available. Most of my past roles were a mix of development with some design.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: So does that mean you’re opposed to doing development?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I wouldn't mind light front-end coding: HTML, CSS/SASS, and Bootstrap. I have no interest in front-end JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. Or doing back-end coding like: C#, .Net, or databases.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Have you done any app development for Android or iPhone?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: No, I have not worked on those kinds of projects. My experience has been light front-end development with design.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What is your strongest development skill?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I'm great with CSS/SASS because its like designing with code.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Your resume seems short. Is this it, or is there more?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Yes there is more. You can see my employment history on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/starcorelabs/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profile. I’ve focused my resume on my design skills and kept it simple to fit on one page.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Looking at your resume your last job was some time ago. Have you been taking time off or looking?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I have been actively looking and applying for design jobs. On top of that I’ve been trying to freelance on the side. I’m confident the right role is out there if I keep looking.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: So are you available immediately?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: Yes, I am available right away. I’m ready to jump in and solve problems with my design skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What platform are you most comfortable with Mac or Windows?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: I prefer Windows when I’m designing.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: What is your target salary?</li>
              <li><span class="m-text">Michael</span>: For pure design roles my range is $60K to $65K. If the position includes any front-end coding my range is $65K to $70K.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="r-text">Recruiter</span>: Thank you for your time. Hope you have a good day.</li>
