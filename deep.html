<p>You are reading this page because you've asked me personal questions.</p>
               
<p>Well buckle up buttercup because it's going to be a bumpy ride. </p>
        
<p>Empty your cup of assumptions and judgment. It will make you open and able to accept who I am.</p>
<p>I am not a typical person. I'm odd and think differently because I'm a high-functioning autistic. Being autistic means I am biologically wired differently. I see things differently and I'm motivated by different things. Whatever you think I might want is just you projecting your own desires on to me. You are wrong. Stop it.</p>
               
<p>I'm going to challenge all your misconceptions. Please don't assume you know me. I'm older than I look, smarter, wiser, and more skilled than I let people see. I don't enjoy answering personal questions. So if you ask them, be prepared to answer them as well.</p>
                   
<p>I will respect your beliefs but I do not share them. Nor do I want to talk about them. Don't try to convert me to your religion and/or political stance. Your personal beliefs are personal, keep them to yourself. Especially in a work environment, keep it professional. Do not talk to me about religion or politics. Thank you.</p> 
           
<p>Most autistic people are above average in intelligence. They tend to interact with the world differently than a neuro-typical person would. Do not assume that autistic people are stupid or retarded. Even those who are less functional are actually quite brilliant in their own way. They just have a harder time interacting socially.</p>
               
<p>For example when I'm in a crowded room like an office or a busy restaurant. I process sensory information differently. From my point of view all the sounds blend together into one sound. It takes a lot of focus for me to listen through the noise. This is why I prefer silence or interacting in small groups.</p>
  
<p>Some people have accents that my ears do not like. If you pronounce words with a "twang". Part of the words seem to distort and twisted. It is very annoying. That's just one example of hundreds of little things I deal with everyday. To me its normal. To others I'm strange.</p>  

<p>I didn't choose any of this just as you didn't choose your height or the color of your eyes. It is just how I am. Accept  me as I am or don't interact with me. Either way I'm going to be myself.</p>

<p>Most autistic people have horrible social skills. I've spent time studying and learning how to interact with people. It was not easy and sometimes I do not pick up on the subtle social cues other people put out.</p>

<p>This is not something I'm doing on purpose to be a jerk. I'm simply unable to pick up those signals.</p>

<p>Most of the time I'm busy focused on what I am doing.</p>

<p>By nature I am a very introverted person. I prefer to spend most of my time alone. I have taught myself how to interact with other people. Sometimes I talk too much and annoy people without meaning too. When I choose to interact my goal is to make people laugh.</p>

<p>I have blood-sugar problems. Basically I do not eat sweets of any kind because they make me feel sick. Don't worry about it. I don't miss sweet stuff. I have adapted myself to a very specific diet that helps me balance my blood sugar. Do not offer me food or sweets.</p>

<p>I don't want to be rude but I do not know how the food you are offering will affect me. I don't want to feel like crap so do us both a favor and don't offer me any food. Just accept that I know what what works for me. I'm 40 years old and I know how to take care of myself.</p>

<p>I do not like conflict, debate, being told what to do, what to think, how to live, other people's unrealistic expectations, and/or hostility of any kind. If I don't ask for advice then don't offer it.</p>

<p>When people are rude or harsh I stop interacting with them. I do not forgive or forget. If you are rude or disrespect me once we are done. That is how I am wired. I have better things to do with my time.</p>

<p>When you think of me keep this quote in mind, "Whatever you want I don't have it. Whatever you're selling I don't want it."</p>
<p>I do not want the typical lifestyle most American's want. I'm a minimalist and I prize my own knowledge and skills above everything else.</p>

<p>I'm motivated by my own inner creative drives, interests in learning, and my love of peace and quiet.</p>


<p>I am friendly with everyone but that doesn't mean I count everyone as my friend. To be my friend requires trust earned over time. I'm well trained in reading people and watching the patterns of their behavior over time. True colors always come bleeding through.</p>

<p>However, at this point in my life I do not have time to be social or date. When I'm not working at my day job I'm busy working on my small business.</p>

<p>My whole focus is on improving and running my business. Every spare moment is spent expanding my knowledge and skills, marketing, and building projects for clients.</p>

<p>I don't do well working for a company under a manager with co-workers. That whole model causes me too many headaches. My goal is simply to work for myself, making enough money to live comfortably.</p>

<p>That's all you need to know about me.</p>
