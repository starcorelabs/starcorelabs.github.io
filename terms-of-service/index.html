<p>Any claim related to starcorelabs.com website shall be governed by United States law without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
<h3>10. Pricing Packages</h3>
<p>We do not charge by the hour, offer split payments, or subscriptions. Instead, we offer <strong>four pricing packages</strong> that cover most common design needs. This approach keeps pricing simple, predictable, and easy to understand. You always know the cost before work begins, no surprises.</p>
<p>Each package is <strong>paid in full before the project starts</strong>. This allows us to focus fully on your work without interruptions from invoices, reminders, or payment follow-ups. Paying upfront also helps create clear expectations and a strong commitment from both sides.</p>
<h3>11. Large Projects</h3>
<p>Large or complex projects may be broken into <strong>smaller tasks or phases</strong>. These tasks are tracked using <strong>Trello</strong>, which helps keep work organized, transparent, and easy to follow. This ensures steady progress and clear communication throughout the project.</p>
<h3>12. What We Mean by “Design”</h3>
<p>For clarity, <strong>design</strong> refers only to visual and structural design work. This includes the planning and creation of visual assets and interface layouts. Design does <strong>not</strong> include software development, coding, marketing, SEO, copywriting, or project management.</p>
<h3>13. Services and Deliverables</h3>
<p>We only offer the following design services and deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design research and discovery</li>
<li>Branding and logo design</li>
<li>Sitemaps, flowcharts, and user flows</li>
<li>Wireframes</li>
<li>Interactive prototypes</li>
<li>Landing page designs</li>
<li>Custom graphic design projects</li>
</ul>
<h3>14. Clear Expectations</h3>
<p>By choosing one of our pricing packages, you agree to the scope, timeline, and deliverables defined for that package. Additional requests, changes in direction, or new features may require a new agreement or an additional fee.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a smooth, focused, and professional design experience built on trust, clarity, and respect for everyone’s time.</p>
<h3>15. No-Refund Policy</h3>
<p>All design work requires careful planning, focused time, and hands-on effort. Because of this, <strong>all payments are final and non-refundable</strong> once a project has started.</p>
<p>When work begins, we immediately invest time in research, planning, and design specifically for your project. This work cannot be reused or resold, even if the project changes or ends early.</p>
<p>This policy helps keep pricing fair for all clients and allows us to stay fully focused on delivering thoughtful and high-quality design work. By moving forward with a project, you agree to this no-refund policy and understand that your payment secures dedicated time and creative effort.</p>
<h3>16. Limited Revisions</h3>
<p>Each pricing package includes a set number of bulk revisions. During the Design Phase, we follow the agreed plan and create draft designs for you to review. As you receive each draft, you can make a list of what you like and what you want changed.</p>
<p>As long as your requests stay within the project’s agreed scope, we will apply all approved changes during the Verification and Revisions Phase. Larger projects usually include more drafts and revisions to make sure everything turns out right.</p>
<p>Any unused revisions expire when the project deadline is reached. If you request additional changes after the project is complete, a new pricing package will be required. This keeps the process fair, organized, and on schedule for both of us.</p>
<h3>17. Final Delivery</h3>
<p>Once all designs and revisions are finished, we schedule a final review meeting to make sure everything looks correct and meets your goals. After you approve the work, we prepare the final files in the agreed formats. All deliverables, including the original source files, are neatly organized and packaged into one ZIP file so you can easily download and use them.</p>
