<p><span class="semibold">10. Prepaid Design Service</span><br/>
Starcore Labs offers a narrow scope of prepaid packages of design services. Customers are prepaying for the hours of design work and revisions the designer will perform based on tasks submitted through Trello.</p>
<p>Note: Prepaid package hours cover both design and revisions combined.</p>
<p>Starcore Labs defines design as creating icons, logos, marks, symbols, images, flowcharts, and graphical representations of software interfaces. We do not offer coding or programming.</p>
<p>Starcore Labs offers the following UX/UI and Graphic Design service deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logo Design</li>
<li>User Flows</li>
<li>Landing Pages</li>
<li>App Mockups</li>
<li>SaaS Prototypes</li>
<li>Custom Graphics</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="semibold">11: Design Work</span><br/>
Starcore Labs reserves the right to post screenshots of design work on this website and on social media as part of advertising our services. Unless customers indicate via email that they've chosen to opt-out.</p>
<p><span class="semibold">12: No-Refund Policy</span><br/>
Starcore Labs has a no-refund policy. Due to the time-consuming nature of our high-quality work, we do not offer any refunds.</p>
<p>We do not pro-rate unused hours if a project is completed faster than expected.</p>
<p>We offer unlimited revisions during the prepaid hours to ensure customers are happy with the final deliverables. However, if customers are not happy with the direction of the work we will make every effort to revise the project to satisfy the customer as long as prepaid time remains. Or, if the customer chooses, we can stop working and provide them with the incomplete source files of the project.</p>
<p>When a customer's prepaid time is about to run out, and the tasks and/or revisions are incomplete, we will send the customer a message letting them know. Customers can either accept the incomplete work “as is” or prepay more time to have us complete the work. Depending on our current booking schedule.</p>
<p>Once prepaid time runs out the designer will stop working, inform the customer, and wait for them to decide. We give customers 48 hours to decide what they want to do. Because we are busy, if customers don’t respond within the 48-hour window, we will assume the project has ended and upload all deliverables and incomplete source files for the project to Trello along with a Project Conclusion Message.</p>
