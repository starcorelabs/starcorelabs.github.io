Do you need a freelance developer to optimize assets, refresh a design, create a landing page or build a full site?

I'm happy to collaborate with you to create a beautiful easy to use solution. 

Here's a brief overview of the services I offer and my development process. 

### Services
1. UI Development for existing projects.
2. Static Sites using [11ty / Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
3. Wordpress - Setup, Configuration, and UI Development.
4. Custom Solution - Depends on the unique requirements of your project.

### Process
When working with clients I follow a simple three step process:

1. I ask questions and listen to understand. I make sure I know the goal, that we are solving the right problem, and I am right for your project.
2. We review my contract together and clarify time frame, scope of service, mile stones, and pricing.
3. Once the contract is signed and the first payment is made, then my work begins.

### Value Based Pricing
Each project is unique and so is it's ongoing value to the client. 

Pricing for a project depends on many variables: 
- The current market
- Your company's size
- Your clients needs and vision
- Project complexity
- UX Design 
- Technology requirements
- Scope 
- Time frame

### Payments
Payments are split up into two parts. Half upfront and half upon completion of the project. 
After full payment has been made. Then the source files will be zipped and emailed and/or implemented, depending on the requirements of the project.

At the moment I accept payments through: PayPal and Square.
