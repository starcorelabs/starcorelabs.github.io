* Added Social Media Icons and links to the footer
* Created a Video page and a Blog page but have not finished or linked them to the index.
* Instead of creating a seperate resume page I decided to just use LinkedIn. 
* Decided to add skill levels to my LinkedIn profile instead of on my web site.
* I have a few blog posts I want to write out and add to the blog page before making it live.
