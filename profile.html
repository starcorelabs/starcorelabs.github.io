<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>You are reading this page because you've asked me personal questions. 
Most of the time people either don't understand me or take me the wrong way. Which is fine with me. I'm use to it.</p>

<p>However, answering the same questions over and over has become annoying.
I've decided to write out this profile page so I don't have to repeat myself.</p> 

<p>Empty your cup of assumptions and buckle up buttercup because I'm going to challenge all your misconceptions. This is your only warning, parts of this page will very be harsh. Deal with it. No where in this profile will I claim to be a "Nice Guy".</p> 

<p>The first thing you should know is that I'm doing what works for me and focusing on my goals. If you treat me with kindness and respect I'll do the same in return. Otherwise, I will stop interating with you. I do not waste time talking with people I don't like.</p>

<p>I do not tolerate immaturity or hostility at all.</p>



&nbsp;
<h3>Problems and Limitations</h3>
<p>I'm a high-functioning autistic. Being autistic means I am biologically wired differently. I see things differently and I'm motivated by different things. Whatever you think I might want is only your own subconscious projecting your desires on to me. You are wrong. Stop it.</p>

<p>I process sensory information differently. From my point of view, when I'm in a crowded room, all the sounds blend together into one sound. It takes a lot of focus for me to listen through the noise. This is why I prefer silence or interacting in small groups.</p>

<p>Most autistic people have horrible social skills. I've spent time studying and learning how to interact with people. It was not easy and sometimes I do not pick up on the subtle social cues other people put out.</p>

<p>This is not something I'm doing on purpose to be a jerk. I'm simply unable to pick up those signals.</p>

<p>By nature I am very introverted. I prefer to spend most of my time alone. I have taught myself how to interact with other people. Sometimes when I'm around people I talk too much and annoy others without meaning too. When I choose to interact my goal is to make people laugh. This because I'm practicing my comedy skills and trying to improve them. If you don't feel like talking just tell me. I'll will leave you alone.</p> 

<p>I have blood-sugar problems. Basically I do not eat sweets of any kind because they make me feel sick. Don't worry about it. I don't miss sweet stuff. I have adapted myself to a very specific diet that helps me balance my blood sugar. Do not offer me food or sweets.</p>

<p>When my blood sugar goes too high or low it causes me migraine headaches and my whole body hurts. I cannot focus or think straight. I get very impatient and irritable. You might take it like I'm angry or upset. It is just my fucked up bio-chemstry.</p>

<p>Do not offer me words to help me feel better. My issue is not mental or emotional. You are only wasting time and it will only irritate me more. The only things that work is time, food, and sleep. Usually I just have to wait for my body to balance out my blood sugar.</p> 

<p>My anxiety and depresson are directly linked with my blood sugar issues. When my blood sugar is balanced I'm fine.</p> 

<p>While I do appreciate the offer. I do not know how the food you're offering will affect me. I don't want to feel like crap. Do us both a favor and don't offer me any food. Just accept that I know what what works for me. I'm 40 years old and I know how to take care of myself.</p>

<p>I do not like conflict, debate, being judged, being told what to do, what to think, how to live, other people's unrealistic expectations put on me, immaturity, and/or hostility of any kind. If I don't ask for your advice then don't offer it. If you choose to judge me. I will use my well trained observation skills and point out all of your flaws. I'm getting pretty good at it. Don't tempt me.</p>

<p>When people are rude or harsh I stop interacting with them. I do not forgive or forget. If you are rude or disrespect me once we are done. That is how I am wired. I have better things to do with my time.</p>


&nbsp;
<h3>Age</h3>
<p>I was born in 1975 which makes me 40 years old as of 2015. Yes, I know I look younger than 40. Some people have a hard time believing it. 

<p>I like to point out that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136/" target="_blank">Johnny Depp</a> is 52 and doesn't look that old. Some people age better than others. Please just accept it and move on.</p>

<p>Looking younger than my age is not a blessing, it is a curse. It causes me nothing but trouble.</p>

<p>Some narrow-minded people cannot see past my youthful apperance. They make assumptions about me and/or talk down to me. Do not do this. It is offensive and I will stop interacting with you and cut you out of my life faster than you can blink.</p>
<p>Idiots who judge people's intelligence based on their appearance can go fuck themselves.</p>


&nbsp;
<h3>Dislikes</h3>
<p>Here's a list of things I dislike. If this list offends you then stop reading immediately and don't interact with me again.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Purfume and/or Cologne</li>
    <li>Fluorescent lights</li>
    <li>Loud Noise</li>
    <li>Fans, wind and/or moving air</li>
    <li>Kids and/or immature people of any age</li>
    <li>Disrespectful, competitive, judgmental, rude, hostile, and/or manipulative people</li>
    <li>Germs</li>
    <li>Wasting Time</li>
    <li>Small Talk</li>
    <li>Pets</li>
    <li>Mental Laziness</li>
</ul>

<p>I prefer things quiet, still, and with just enough light to read by.</p>


&nbsp;
<h3>Relationships and Dating</h3>
<p>I am selectively social. I am not a needy person. I don't usually get lonely. Now and then I enjoy intelligent converstations and/or making people laugh.</p>

<p>Still, I have very little free time and I do not waste it on just anyone.</p> 

<p>I am currently divorced and I have had a lot of girlfriends over my lifetime.
My last girlfriend turned out to be a user and a cheater so I have quit dating.</p>

<p>I am only open to making new friends at this point in my life.
Until my business is a success I do not have time for dating.</p>

<p>If I decide to date again I will be following these rules:</p>
<p>I will not date any woman who:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Is under 30 years old</li>
    <li>Works with me</li>
    <li>Has kids or who wants kids</li>
    <li>Has pets</li>
    <li>Drinks, smokes, or uses drugs</li>
    <li>Is religious</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I know that limits my options but I would rather be alone than settle for someone who annoyes me.</p>


&nbsp;
<h3>Personal History</h3>
<p>I grew up in a small racist redneck town which I do not like. My family still lives there. As you can imagine my childhood sucked. 
Most of my family is hostile and judgemental toward me. So I avoid them.</p> 

<p>My childhood taught me that Its better to be self-reliant and self-sufficient. The only person in my family that I like and talk to is my Mom.</p>


&nbsp;
<h3>Beliefs, Values, and Principles</h3> 
<p>I will acknowledge your beliefs but I do not share them. Nor do I want to talk about them. Don't try to convert me to your religion and/or political stance. Your personal beliefs are personal. Unless you want me to mock you for whatever mythology you ascribe to, keep it to yourself.</p>

<p>Especially in a work environment, keep it professional. Do not talk to me about religion or politics. If we work together and you try to push your belief-system on me I will report you to human resourcs. Don't test me.</p>

<p>Follow the local laws and the rules of whatever work environment we might share and we will get along fine.</p> 

<p>I feel no need to explain my beliefs to anyone.</p>


&nbsp;
<h3>Things and Money</h3>
<p>I put my needs before my wants and pay my debts on time.</p>
<p>In a personal setting my motto is, "Whatever you want I don't have it. Whatever you're selling I don't want it."</p>
<p>I do not loan my things or money. I don't borrow things or money either.</p> 

<p>If I give you a gift or share food with you its because I respect you.
Do not disrspect me, my time, or my things. Definitely do not take me for granted.</p>

<p>While doing business I do not work for free and I always 100% of the time require a contract. If you are unwilling to sign my contract then hire someone else.</p>


&nbsp;
<h3>Interests, Motivation, and Goals</h3>
<p>Here's a list of things I enjoy talking about and doing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>Comics</li>
    <li>Books</li>
    <li>Comedy</li>
    <li>YouTube</li>
    <li>Anime</li>
    <li>TV Shows</li>
    <li>Movies</li>
    <li>Video Games</li>
    <li>Graphic Design</li>
    <li>Web Development</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm motivated by my own inner creative drives, interests in learning, and my love of peace and quiet.</p>

<p>My whole focus is on improving and running my business. Every spare moment is spent expanding my knowledge and skills, marketing my services, and building projects for clients.</p>

<p>I don't do well working for a company under a manager with co-workers. That whole model causes me too many headaches. My goal is simply to work for myself, making enough money to live comfortably.</p>


<p>That's all you need to know about me.</p>
