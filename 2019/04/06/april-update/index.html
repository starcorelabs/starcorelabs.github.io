                <p>Recently a few curious readers have asked me what I’ve been doing.<br>I’ve resisted responding because my current situation is depressing and I didn’t want to burden anyone else with my problems.</p>
<p>Against my better judgment I’m reluctantly posting this update with the intention to inform.</p>
<p>Do not assign your own motivations to my words. I’m only telling my story from my point of view to the best of my ability. Please don’t take my frustration as if I’m blaming anyone or anything for my situation. Sometimes things happen beyond anyone’s control.</p>
<p>Please direct all comments and questions to <a href="mailto:starcorelabs@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starcorelabs@gmail.com</a>.  </p>
<h3 id="Job-Hunt"><a href="#Job-Hunt" class="headerlink" title="Job Hunt"></a>Job Hunt</h3><p>The contract for my last job as a full-time UX Developer ended June 30th 2017. While I liked the work and most of the people. Some aspects of the environment had grown toxic. So I was relieved to move on.</p>
<p>At the time I didn’t have any debts and had saved up a little nest egg so I wasn’t worried about my finances. I figured I’d  talk with people in my network, check job listing sites, and find another position within a couple weeks. I had no idea how bad the job market had become while I was working.</p>
<p>None of my contacts had any leads on jobs within my field. The jobs I saw in the listings all preferred Bachelor’s degrees. Some unrealistically required years of experience in technologies only months old.</p>
<p>I found comments under some of these listings, and in online forums, where web developer veterans with Bachelor’s degrees and 10+ years of experience said they were being turned down for being “Too Over-Qualified”. Which sounds insane to me. Why not hire the best people who are willing to take a pay cut because they have bills to pay?</p>
<p>When I applied for Front-End Developer positions I was met with a few consistent responses. Recruiters would take my information, promise to get back to me in a couple of days, and then ghost on me. Some would send me an email letting me know they appreciated my application but the client decided to go in another direction. A rare few would tell me I was either under or over-qualified for the position.</p>
<p>To be under or over-qualified sounds strange when comparing similar roles over the course of a couple of days. Maybe I simply didn’t have the skills or personality they were looking for. I’ll never know.</p>
<h3 id="Career-Change"><a href="#Career-Change" class="headerlink" title="Career Change"></a>Career Change</h3><p>For a few months I experimented with the possibility of changing my career to UX Design. I had worked closely with designers during my time as a developer. I already had many existing cross-over skills. So, I spent some time filling in gaps by learning the basics of design, improving my Photoshop and Illustrator skills, learning wire-framing and prototyping, as well as industry standard best practices for site mapping and web application layout.</p>
<p>I used these skills to design and develop my own Wordpress website from scratch while creating a video series on my YouTube channel to show off my skills.</p>
<p>I’m a visual, creative, and task-oriented person. Focused on determining the right problem to solve and the steps needed to accomplish the goal quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>UX Design seemed like a natural fit for my mindset and temperament. Unfortunately my track record up to that point had been in Front-End Development and having no Degree in Design or a diverse enough portfolio meant my skills didn’t measure up to what they required.</p>
<h3 id="Another-Path"><a href="#Another-Path" class="headerlink" title="Another Path"></a>Another Path</h3><p>Under the suggestion of a colleague I spent a couple of months learning Salesforce Administration in the hopes it might help me get a job quickly. I completed a video training course I found online. Then moved over to Trailhead to complete their training and earn badges.</p>
<p>I was 80% done with the basic course when I spoke with a recruiter who deals with Salesforce jobs in my area. He said that Trailhead badges are nice but the majority of companies he works with won’t hire new Salesforce Administrators without some kind of Bachelor’s Degree. He hinted that those roles are given to people fresh out of college because they can be easily controlled and molded. I didn’t entirely believe him but then again what benefit would he get from lying to me?</p>
<p>A few similar conversations with other recruiters made me reconsider learning Salesforce Administration. From what they said a Certification alone wouldn’t be enough education to land a position before my funds ran out. Without the guarantee of a job waiting for me. I decide that continuing to learn Salesforce wasn’t going to land me a job fast enough.  </p>
<h3 id="Low-Paying-Jobs"><a href="#Low-Paying-Jobs" class="headerlink" title="Low Paying Jobs"></a>Low Paying Jobs</h3><p>I didn’t have the money or the time to go back to school to get a Degree so I considered other options. I had run out of savings and was in dire need of a job. I’m not entitled or proud. All I wanted was to earn enough money to cover my expenses. So, I started applying for all the jobs in my area that I was qualified for.</p>
<p>Back in 2008 I started my IT career doing over-the-phone technical support working in call centers. So I applied to all the open help desk positions I could find.</p>
<p>After that, I looked for any job that paid enough to keep me afloat. Applying for jobs doing Janitorial, Dish Washing, and even Fast Food.</p>
<p>Most of the applications I put in never received a response. I got tired of waiting so I called a few contacts within those companies. They told me I was too over-qualified for the position. They didn’t want to waste time putting me on their pay roll because, based on my resume, they assumed I’d find a higher paying job in a few weeks and bail on them. I tried to explain my unusual situation and was willing to negotiate but they weren’t open to further conversation.</p>
<h3 id="Freelancing"><a href="#Freelancing" class="headerlink" title="Freelancing"></a>Freelancing</h3><p>Nothing else was working and I needed an income so I decided to try freelancing. I rebuilt my website on GitHub and started offering my skills as a designer and developer. I considered looking into freelancing sites like Fiverr and Upwork but their terms of service and the horror stories of too much competition and low pay I read from other freelances turned me away.</p>
<p>I tried to market my own website. I put out a few posts on Social Media and some online forums telling potential clients how I could help them solve their problems with the reasonably priced services I offer.</p>
<p>I had a few tire kickers but no serious clients.</p>
<h3 id="Brick-Wall"><a href="#Brick-Wall" class="headerlink" title="Brick Wall"></a>Brick Wall</h3><p>At this point I’ve hit a brick wall and have no idea what to do. I’ve spoken with family, friends, and colleagues. All of them repeated similar suggestions like: Rewriting my resume for the millionth time, going directly to the company to apply, talking with people who already work there, spending time learning new skills, and other things I’ve already done. As of this post I’m completely out of money and cannot borrow anymore from family because they are broke.</p>
<p>I have bills coming due in a couple weeks that I cannot pay which means I’m going to have to move out of my apartment and lose access to the internet. I’m beyond stressed, frustrated, and depressed. I think I’m in shock and have become emotionally numb to this situation.</p>
<p>All I’ve wanted to do this whole time is use the skills I’ve spent lots of money and years learning, to earn a decent living.</p>
<p>Online research has revealed my situation is not unique. There a many people who have more experience, skills, and degrees than I do, who are struggling to find jobs. Clearly this isn’t anyone’s fault. Its just the way things are right now.</p>
<p>Don’t trust unemployment reports or anything you see online. Instead talk to real people who are currently looking for a job. You’ll be surprised at what they tell you.</p>
<h3 id="Website"><a href="#Website" class="headerlink" title="Website"></a>Website</h3><p>I’ve owned the <a href="http://starcorelabs.com">starcorelabs.com</a> domain since 2016. Since then I’ve redesign and re-purposed this site countless times. None of my efforts have increased traffic, enticed readers to purchase my services, or earned me a dime. I did it all with the hope that it would help me find a decent job.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I do not have the money to pay for the upcoming renewal of my domain. This website will still be available at <a href="http://starcorelabs.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starcorelabs.github.io</a>. At this point I see no reason to continue paying for something that hasn’t earned me a profit, or the potential for future work.</p>
<h3 id="Writing"><a href="#Writing" class="headerlink" title="Writing"></a>Writing</h3><p>I enjoy writing blog posts. However, since I will be losing access to the internet soon I won’t be able to post as often. I’ll keep writing offline and post if I’m able.</p>
<h3 id="Gaming"><a href="#Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Gaming"></a>Gaming</h3><p>My current situation is all-consuming. The level of stress and frustration I feel daily is exhausting. I have no desire to play games. I’ve been too busy trying to find a job. Games can wait until I get my financial situation sorted out.</p>
<h3 id="Help"><a href="#Help" class="headerlink" title="Help"></a>Help</h3><p>I want to work. If you want to help, hire me.<br>Send any job listings and/or offers to <a href="mailto:starcorelabs@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starcorelabs@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>I’m respectful, smart, flexible, humble, and available to start working immediately.</p>
<p>What I’m looking for is a task-oriented desk job that I can do right now that doesn’t require a Bachelor’s Degree or more certifications. If you hire me and give me a list of things to do, I’ll turn on beast mode and get to work.</p>
<p>You can review my <a href="http://starcorelabs.com/resume.pdf">resume</a> and see my education, skills, and experience.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick summary: I’ve worked in sales, customer service, and over the phone technical support. I’m highly computer literate. I build computers, used all major operating systems but prefer <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux Mint</a> as my main OS.</p>
<p>I’ve designed and help code large scale corporate websites and web applications. I’ve research, written, and edited internal technical documents. I’ve had many people praise my technical writing, creative suggestions, and proof-reading skills. Finally, I have three Certifications in Hypnotherapy.</p>
<p>Time is running out. I have until April 15th to earn $300.00 to get me through this month. That’s not enough time to learn any new skills or earn any new Certifications. I need to start working and earning money by Monday, April 8th.</p>
<p>Once hired I would be happy to be of service using my existing skills while learn new skills and attaining new certifications. All to provide more valuable to the company.</p>
<p>Until then, all I can do is keep putting in applications and wait to see what happens next.</p>
