<p>There is a gap in my employment that gives recruiters and hiring managers some concerns. This post is meant to explain the cascade of events that caused the gap and remove those concerns.</p>
<h3 id="Q-Why-is-there-a-gap-in-your-employment"><a href="#Q-Why-is-there-a-gap-in-your-employment" class="headerlink" title="Q: Why is there a gap in your employment?"></a>Q: Why is there a gap in your employment?</h3><p>The short-term contract for my job with Navient ended at the end of June in 2017. I wanted to be hired on full-time but it was only a short-term contract. I learned a lot and liked everyone I worked with. I’ve stayed in touch with many of them. Most have moved on to other positions outside Navient.</p>
<h3 id="Q-Did-you-look-for-a-new-job"><a href="#Q-Did-you-look-for-a-new-job" class="headerlink" title="Q: Did you look for a new job?"></a>Q: Did you look for a new job?</h3><p>When my contract ended I started applying to UX Development positions immediately. Most of these positions required a Bachelor’s Degree and 3+ years experience in React, Angular, or Vue.</p>
<p>It seems while I was busy working at Navient doing HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript, other companies decided being a UX Developer required JavaScript frameworks. I was passed over because I lacked a degree or experience with any JavaScript frameworks.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am willing to learn React, Angular, or Vue. Its just going to take time and practice. Most of the recruiters I’ve interacted with told me their clients want developers who can hit the ground running and to start contributing immediately. Which filtered me out.</p>
<h3 id="Q-Did-you-have-any-health-or-legal-problems"><a href="#Q-Did-you-have-any-health-or-legal-problems" class="headerlink" title="Q: Did you have any health or legal problems?"></a>Q: Did you have any health or legal problems?</h3><p>No health or legal issues. Other than minor blood sugar problems which makes me tired. I don’t eat sugary foods, consume caffeine, smoke, drink alcohol, or even take pain medication because I’m too sensitive. I’m only addicted to the internet, seltzer water, and burritos.</p>
<p>Most of the time I stay home, build linux-based computers, study to improve my skills, write in my blog, and watch YouTube videos. I haven’t had a speeding or parking ticket in 10 years. Single, no kids, pets, not even a house plant. Just me by myself most of the time.</p>
<p>While I was working at Navient I passed the 5C Security Clearance without issue. They told me I was boring. Which I took as a compliment.</p>
<h3 id="Q-How-did-you-spend-your-time-while-not-working"><a href="#Q-How-did-you-spend-your-time-while-not-working" class="headerlink" title="Q: How did you spend your time while not working?"></a>Q: How did you spend your time while not working?</h3><p>I didn’t sit idle. I used my time to train and improve my skills.</p>
<p>I spent time building a Wordpress theme for my site. Which I recorded as a short YouTube series: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB4vVkDTaew&amp;list=PLtO-pPfi3wPGgEo1Y5MOoGpxWxTbvKKuN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wireframe to Wordpress</a>. In Episode 9 I got creative and made a <a href="https://youtu.be/fwh2EZ6u8Lc?t=479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time-lapse</a> of myself writing CSS code.</p>
<p>Later I used online video resources to improve my <a href="https://starcorelabs.github.io/2019/03/02/modern-javascript/">JavaScript ES6+</a> skills. Building a few small projects to learn and apply the new syntax. Then I moved on to the basics of React.</p>
<p>When I couldn’t afford my Wordpress hosting and domain I decided to rebuilt my blog using <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo</a> and host it on GitHub Pages for free.</p>
<p>All while continuing to apply for jobs I know I can do.</p>
<h3 id="Q-What-feedback-did-you-get-from-recruiters"><a href="#Q-What-feedback-did-you-get-from-recruiters" class="headerlink" title="Q: What feedback did you get from recruiters?"></a>Q: What feedback did you get from recruiters?</h3><p>I’ve spoken with over 80+ recruiters. Directly or indirectly they all told me I didn’t measure up. No matter how many times I rewrote my resume, demonstrated my skills with blog posts, github repos, or YouTube videos, it was never enough.</p>
<p>A lot of recruiters acted like gatekeepers and refused to submit me to roles. Over half of the recruiters I spoke with ghosted on me. The few that did give me feedback said either the role was canceled, filled, or that I was under-qualified or over-qualified.</p>
<p>I have no real answers as to why I kept getting rejected. It is a competitive market so I chalked it up to companies preferring people with degrees.</p>
<h3 id="Q-After-being-rejected-what-did-you-do"><a href="#Q-After-being-rejected-what-did-you-do" class="headerlink" title="Q: After being rejected what did you do?"></a>Q: After being rejected what did you do?</h3><p>After a year of rejections it seemed like the door to UX Development was closed to me. So, I decided to switch careers and try moving into UX Design. UX Development overlaps many of the same skills as UX Design.</p>
<p>To fill the gaps in my knowledge I spent a few months improving my skills in Design, Wireframing, Prototyping, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and other UX tools. I even built a few projects to demonstrate my skills.</p>
<p>I read online posts about all the tips and tricks to impressing recruiters to land an interview. I falsely assumed if I had a better portfolio that showed my skills companies would give me an interview. I built and re-built my website portfolio 10 times and rewrote my resume 50+ times. I said all the right things, asked all the right questions, but still couldn’t get past recruiters. They took my information, promise to keep me in the loop, and then ghost on me. This happened so many times I felt like I was in the movie Groundhog Day.</p>
<h3 id="Q-How-did-you-pay-your-bills"><a href="#Q-How-did-you-pay-your-bills" class="headerlink" title="Q: How did you pay your bills?"></a>Q: How did you pay your bills?</h3><p>My savings ran out and I had to borrow money from family to pay my bills. The stress and panic of not knowing why I was being rejected wore me down. I became severely depressed and hopeless. I felt completely broken and useless. It is impossible to express living with that kind of feeling for months on end. Not knowing if you’ll be able to pay your bills or buy food. It was a nightmare.</p>
<p>I reached out to family, friends, and colleges in my network. Asking them if they knew of any open positions? All I hoped for was a phone interview. Two people responded saying if they heard of anything they would let me know. The rest never replied.</p>
<p>A year had gone by and I’d been through 80 IT recruiters twice. When I called them the second time around they acted like I had offended them. They wouldn’t return my calls or emails.</p>
<h3 id="Q-What-else-have-you-tried"><a href="#Q-What-else-have-you-tried" class="headerlink" title="Q: What else have you tried?"></a>Q: What else have you tried?</h3><p>I’m not proud or entitled and nothing is beneath me. I just want to work and pay my bills. Out of desperation I started applying for any job that paid enough to cover my bills. I applied for cleaning jobs, fast food, retail, customer service, and even going back to technical support.</p>
<p>A few of these companies took one look at my resume and told me that I was over-qualified for the job. The rest never responded at all.</p>
<h3 id="Have-you-tried-freelancing"><a href="#Have-you-tried-freelancing" class="headerlink" title="Have you tried freelancing?"></a>Have you tried freelancing?</h3><p>I looked into freelancing but all the options I saw online seemed like a scam or a waste of time. I don’t have money to risk on possibilities. I needed a reliable income last year.</p>
<p>I don’t have a lot of personal property. When my savings got low I sold my books, old games, and used electronics to buy food and pay bills. When I ran out of things to sell I had to borrow more money from family to cover my rent. Feeling depressed and worthless I kept putting myself out there. Kept applying for jobs that I knew I had the skills for. While turning down random recruiters who messaged me on LinkedIn or through email asking if I was interested in C# Developer jobs.</p>
<p>First off, C# is back-end programming and my skills are front-end. Second, if I was a C# Developer I’d already have a job. Third, learning C#, or any back-end programming language, is like learning to speak a foreign language. No one can learn to read and speak Spanish over a weekend. It takes years to become proficient enough in programming to work at the corporate level. I don’t have that kind of time and it would be pointless to apply for a job I know I can’t do.</p>
<h3 id="Q-How-are-you-doing-now"><a href="#Q-How-are-you-doing-now" class="headerlink" title="Q: How are you doing now?"></a>Q: How are you doing now?</h3><p>Currently I’m broke and it is hurting my family to keep loaning me money. My 12 month apartment lease renewal came up at the end of May. I love my apartment and want to stay but without an income its impossible. So I didn’t renew my lease. I have until July 21 before my lease ends. Then I will have no where to go. I cannot live with family because there is no room. Plus, they smoke and it burns my sinuses.</p>
<p>I’ve been talking with a few companies and had a couple of good interviews recently. But, I’ve been down this road before. After being rejected so many times I’m overly cautious about getting my hopes up. Even if they hired me tomorrow. It would be two or three weeks before I got paid. At this point I don’t have enough money to drive to work everyday. So, I have no idea what I’m going to do.</p>
<h3 id="Q-How-do-you-want-people-to-see-you"><a href="#Q-How-do-you-want-people-to-see-you" class="headerlink" title="Q: How do you want people to see you?"></a>Q: How do you want people to see you?</h3><p>I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me or lend me money. I want to work and earn my own way. I’m a workaholic. I need to cross this bridge and get back to work. I have the intelligence, skills, and drive to do the work. I’m humble enough to ask questions, follow directions, and admit when I’m wrong.</p>
<p>I’m holding out hope that some company with take a chance and hire me. If that happens I’ll be grateful and do everything I can to be the best employee they ever had.</p>
