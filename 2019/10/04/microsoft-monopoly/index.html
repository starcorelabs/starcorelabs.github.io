                <p><img src="/img/microsoft-logo.png" alt="User Experience"></p>
<p>Most people don’t remember the kind of company Microsoft used to be back in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s. They were aggressively corporate, closed-source, and focused on making profits at any cost.</p>
<p>They didn’t innovate. Instead they had a method they called:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embrace, Extend, Extinguish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They bought smaller companies who had technology they wanted or that might some day challenge them. (They just recently bought GitHub)</p>
<p>After purchasing these companies they updated the software products or simply slapped a Microsoft logo on it. (Like they did with Skype).</p>
<p>Then they slowly add whatever features they like to other Microsoft products until eventually they killed off the competitive product. This was how they operated up until Steve Ballmer left Microsoft.</p>
<p>Technically, they still operate this way but they are more laid back and quiet about it.</p>
<p>That’s why back in the early 2000’s Apple ran creative and funny ads, “I’m a Mac and I’m a PC” making fun of just how corporate, unreliable, and profit motivated Microsoft is.</p>
<p>What a lot of people don’t know is that back in the early 2000’s Microsoft came to the Midwest and setup a monopoly. They spent millions selling colleges and businesses on their Windows OS, Servers, Databases, and .NET development environment. (While Apple did something similar on the West Coast)</p>
<p>Microsoft created its “Partnership Program” to gain loyal customers and make billions.</p>
<p>Colleges were given free Windows and Server licenses for a couple of years in exchange for offering .NET classes based on Microsoft’s curriculum. This is why college students can buy full copies of Windows OS for $30.00 and everyone else has to pay $180.00. They are trying to hook them early, like how tobacco companies in the late 1990’s used colorful characters to attract teens.</p>
<p>Businesses that joined the “Partnership Program” were given discounts on bulk licenses for Windows OS, Server, and Databases. This incentivized business to build their infrastructure and web applications using Microsoft technology. Which required them to buy more licenses and technology from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Over the years as these companies grew so did their demand for developers with .NET programming skills. With that demand the local colleges earned more money and developed more detailed and expensive courses for teaching Microsoft Technology. Which they had to purchase from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s “Partner Program” is nothing more than a marketing tactic that forced colleges and business to buy into Microsoft’s walled garden. Now these companies are heavily invested in Microsoft products and deeply programmed to believe that everything else is less powerful and reliable. Which helps maintain Microsoft’s monopoly.</p>
<p>This is why a lot of companies and people in the Midwest have trouble thinking outside of Microsoft’s Box. Its also why in 2019 you’ll see 9 out 10 jobs in technology and/or development will be Microsoft or .NET focused.</p>
<p>While other technologies like Java, PHP, and Python do co-exist and thrive in the area. They don’t have the same level of marketing that Microsoft continually puts in to promoting their technologies.</p>
<p>Even their so-called “Open Source” code and tools tie back into closed source products that profit Microsoft. Its just another branch of their “Embrace, Extend, Extinguish”.</p>
<h4 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h4><p>I’m not against Microsoft for wanting to make a profit or even because, in my opinion, their technology is buggy and full of spyware.</p>
<p>I dislike Microsoft for their predatory and anti-competitive business practices. And how, even to this day, they run a campaign of propaganda to make people believe that their technology is the only reliable option for corporations.</p>
<p>This is why I prefer Open Source operating systems and technologies.</p>
