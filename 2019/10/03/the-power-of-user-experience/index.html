<h4 id="User-Experience-UX"><a href="#User-Experience-UX" class="headerlink" title="User Experience (UX):"></a>User Experience (UX):</h4><p>How your company makes your customers feel is their user experience.</p>
<p>Some companies are so focused on their internal processes and policies they loose sight of the purpose of their existence. Which is to create solutions for their customers.</p>
<p>Allow me to illustrate my point with a short story. I’m not a car guy. I prefer computers. Every time I have to take my car in for repair I dread the process.</p>
<p>All the mechanic shops I’ve been to in the last few years have left me with a bad experience.</p>
<p>Like most professionals I work Monday through Friday 8:00am to 5:00pm.</p>
<p>Repair shops unrealistically assume I can take work off to sit in their dirty uncomfortable waiting rooms for hours while they work on my car.<br>Or, they assume I can drop off my car and leave it over night. As if I have another car or someone who can pick me up.</p>
<p>It never occurs to these “Car Guys” that not all people own multiple cars. Or, have other people who can take off work to pick me up.</p>
<p>When speaking with mechanics they are vague about what their prices are. Using confusing mechanical terminology. As if I know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>In the last couple of years they’ve lied to me, overcharged me, and failed to fix my issue while creating others. Overall I deeply dislike my user experience of dealing with automotive repair shops.</p>
<p>I’ve tried shopping around, talking with people I trust, and checking online reviews of different repair shops with mixed results.</p>
<p>Imagine if this story of confusion and frustration was the experience most of your customers have when interacting with your business.</p>
<p>What is their “User Experience” like. Can you forget your point of view for a moment and step into their shoes? They don’t know about your brand initiative, strategy meetings, corporate policies, or quarterly reports.</p>
<h4 id="Your-users-want-know"><a href="#Your-users-want-know" class="headerlink" title="Your users want know:"></a>Your users want know:</h4><ul>
<li>Do you have the experience and skills to solve my problem?</li>
<li>How long is this going to take?</li>
<li>What do I have to do?</li>
<li>How much will it cost me?<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>When customers approach me to work on web projects they make the mistake of thinking the website or web application they want built is for them. I repeatedly point out the site they want built will server their customers, not their ego. If it doesn’t provide their customers with resources they want. They will go back to Google and keep looking.</p>
<p>As a UX/UI Developer I’m always educating people about “User Experience”. It is not just about making things pretty. Its about making the whole experience of using a web application seamless, smooth, and simple.</p>
<p>There are sites like Amazon and YouTube that many people use to get a result. No one goes in and marvels at the flashy features or the color palette.<br>That’s just fluff. Every part of the application must work together to create harmony and provide a value.</p>
<h4 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h4><p>My goal as a UX/UI Developer is to make web applications that are easy to use, have a modern look, and solve customers problems.</p>
<p>When this is achieved customers become familiar with the web application and consistently use it.</p>
