                <p><img src="/img/cables.jpg" alt="cables"></p>
<p>Since Friday 08/02 I’ve been trying to get Comcast cable Internet at my new apartment. Its been a frustrating battle to say the least.</p>
<p>Back in 2013 at my old apartment it took 10 minutes to connect the equipment and call the company. After a quick test I was online. Based on this past experience I assumed setting it up at my new apartment would be quick and easy. No such luck.</p>
<p>Because I’m at work most of the time I only want basic Internet at my apartment. Here’s the plan that fit what I was looking for.</p>
<p><img src="/img/comcast-performance-starter.png" alt="Comcast Performance Starter"></p>
<p>Its $20 a month for 25Mbps down. Notice this offer says FREE Self-Install kit. That’s a total lie.</p>
<p>When I called them and ask them to turn on the service they lied to me and told me that my new apartment is only provisioned for cable TV. I spoke with my apartment office staff and they said, “Many residents have Comcast Internet”.</p>
<p>Then they lied to me again and told me they’d have to send up a special request ticket to get it turned on at my location. They said it could take up to 6 days and then I’d have to pay $70 for a tech to come out and connect a coaxial cable.</p>
<p>What they don’t know is I was tech support agent for 7 years before becoming a UI Developer. My modem is hooked up and I see a green online ready light which tells me the cable is already hooked up. I know all they have to do is get my modem’s mac address and add it to a speed tier in their system.</p>
<p>But instead of making it simple they over-complicate it to try and confuse me into paying more than it’s worth.</p>
<p>Now they require a year contract with paperless billing and autopay. Which means I don’t get any documentation to show what I’m paying for and they can raise my rate anytime they want. Which they’ve tried to do to me in the past when I wasn’t under a contract. If I turn off autopay they will charge me an extra $10 a month. If I cancel the service before the contract ends I’ll owe them an early termination fee of $500. Plus, I was informed that I’d have to give them a $50.00 deposit before activation.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t included all the insane rules associated with their service.</p>
<p>Regardless, let’s do math to find out how much it would cost me for this FREE Self-Install:</p>
<ul>
<li>$50.00 deposit</li>
<li>$70.00 install fee</li>
<li>$20.00 for the first month</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>140.00 total</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this what business is about these days? Lying and trying to confuse people to make it easier to scam them.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to providing a quality service at a reasonable price?</p>
<p>What happened to earning loyalty by making customers happy?</p>
<p>Seems like all they care about is tricking people into agreeing to a huge monthly fee, with complex rules they can change whenever they like, regardless of what you want or need.</p>
<p>After 6 days of them stringing me along, listening to their lies, I got tired of the game. I told them I refuse to pay a $70 install fee for a service they claimed on their site was “Free Self-Install”. I know its a scam. I told them I’ll go without Internet at my apartment if I have to.</p>
<p>They wanted me to think I don’t have a choice. But I know I do because I have Internet access at my job. Due to their shady practices they’ve lost a customer for life. After all that I’ll never use them again.</p>
<p>I’m currently researching other options in my area. I won’t agree to anything until I do the math and make sure its a good deal.</p>
