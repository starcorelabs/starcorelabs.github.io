                <p><img src="/img/network-cables.png" alt="Network Cables"></p>
<p>In my last post <a href="http://starcorelabs.github.io/2019/08/08/comcast-catastrophe/">Comcast Catastrophe</a> I talked about how I was angry at Comcast for trying to charge me an outrageous install fee of $70.00 to send someone out to connect a cable. Even if I was rich I wouldn’t waste money paying pointless fees like that.</p>
<p>All I want is a reasonable exchange of my money for basic internet service. Comcast over-complicates it to hide their greed. If Comcast sold a box of cereal the way they sell internet service it would be insane and no one would buy it.</p>
<p>Here’s how it would go. The store would not have Cheerios on the shelf. I’d ask one of the staff where is the cereal and they would tell me its a service they offer. Offering me different service level packages. I’d get frustrated because I just want to buy a box of cereal. They would call a manager who’d have to check his chart to see what kind of deals they are having for new customers. Then he’d get out a graph calculator to figure out the overly complex math to tell me what my box of Cheerios will cost me.</p>
<p>He’d say they have a “promotion” and normally that box of cereal is $20.00. But he can let me have it for $10.00 because I’m a new customer. Oh but I have to sign up for their 12 months of cereal service. To get the discount I have to accept paperless billing and autopay. Then they have to check my credit to see if I can afford their cereal service.</p>
<p>There is a fee for locating a box in the warehouse. If they can’t find one then I have to wait for them to find it and ship it to me. They might have to schedule a cereal technician to come to my apartment and make sure I have all the necessary equipment. Which means taking time off work because they are super busy and if I’m not available between 9:00am and 4:00pm on Tuesday then I might have to wait another couple of weeks before another tech can come out.</p>
<p>Once I pick my cereal service there is another fee for processing my payment. Which means I have to pay more money, for them to accept my money. And of course there is a hidden fee for installing a box of cereal in my cabinet. My final bill would be $50.00. When I say, “Wait a minute. You said it was $10.00!” That’s when they smile with a snake like grin.</p>
<p>The manager would say, “Normally its $70.00 but we’re giving you a promotion”. The reason its like this is because they don’t compete with any other cereal distributors in the area.</p>
<p>If a company dominates a service. That’s called a monopoly. Its illegal.</p>
<p>Anyway, because this is how I saw the situation. I was more than a little frustrated and got melodramatic at the end of my last post. I said I would never use Comcast again. After that I took a few days to cool off and figure out my options. I spoke with some co-workers, did internet research, and realigned my mindset.</p>
<p>I knew I could not learn anything or solve the issue while I was in a stressed and frustrated state of mind. During those 3 weeks I used my company internet and Android phone for access. So I wasn’t completely offline.</p>
<p>I looked for an alternative internet service provider in my area. ISP’s do not compete with each other. Even if there are two or more ISP’s in an area. One will always have a ridiculously better deal than the others. Like when one of your friends doesn’t want to play a game and lets you win. Here’s a chart to illustrate my point:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">ISP</th>
<th align="left">Speed</th>
<th align="center">Monthly</th>
<th align="center">Install</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td align="left">Comcast</td>
<td align="left">25Mbps</td>
<td align="center">$30.00</td>
<td align="center">$70.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">AT&amp;T</td>
<td align="left">18Mbps</td>
<td align="center">$50.00</td>
<td align="center">$0.00*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Hughesnet</td>
<td align="left">25Mbps</td>
<td align="center">$59.99</td>
<td align="center">$100.00</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>These are the ISP’s and their cheapest plans in my area. Clearly my options are limited. My apartment is only wired for cable internet. So any other service provider would have a valid reason to charge me an install fee. That would be way outside my budget. (* My apartment doesn’t have phone jacks. AT&amp;T would have to install everything from scratch.)</p>
<p>So I decided I had to find a way to work with Comcast. First I had to change the way I look at Comcast. Instead of seeing it like a large monolithic company. Where the workers are mindless drones doing what they are told without concern for how their actions affect the customers. I had to see it like a group of individuals working to pay their bills.</p>
<p>I started wondering how badly they disrespect and mistreat their workers to make them act this way? Considering how badly they screw over their customers I can imagine working there is no picnic. So I started being super nice to all customer service people I spoke with. Even if they were callous, curt, and rude to me.</p>
<p>Now I think of Comcast as a City with many little businesses inside it all trying to work together. Some groups are happy to wave the the company flag and repeat policies like an oath of allegiance. Other groups begrudgingly pay lip service to the company’s unsavory business practices. While doing whatever they can to help customers get what they paid for. I knew there had to be a few good individuals working in that bureaucratic bee hive.</p>
<p>With this in mind I started calling Comcast on random days to see if I could speak with people who actually care. Sure 8 out of 10 times I’d end speaking with someone who didn’t give a crap. They followed their corporate script, regurgitated the company rules, and gave me the run around. Business as usual.  </p>
<p>Through a few quick Google searches I learned that Comcast has been sued many times in the past for fraudulent installation fees. They are currently dealing with a few class action lawsuits for charging install fees, overcharging, hidden fees, and other shady business practices. There is a whole <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subreddit r/Comcast</a> filled with people venting about their horrible experiences with Comcast. They point out all the illegal things Comcast does and how to use the law to fight back.</p>
<p>This gave me a lot of resources to use if I needed to fill my own lawsuit against them for predatory businesses practices. Thankfully it didn’t come to that.</p>
<p>I kept calling Comcast and explaining that my equipment is already hooked up. I did a self-install so I’m not paying any extra fees.<br>After having two different techs show up and work on the outside wires. I eventually I got a hold of a cool person who helped me sort through the companies purposefully convoluted processes to get my account squared away. Because I did the installation of my equipment myself I didn’t have to pay the install fee.</p>
<p>But the problems weren’t over. Once I had it installed the internet kept dropping out and resetting every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>At first I thought Comcast was doing it on purpose so they would have a reason to send out a tech to “Fix” the problem. Giving them an excuse to charge me more money.</p>
<p>After a couple of days of the internet cutting out and restarting I finally called in and spoke with an awesome tech. She was super smart and professional. She made a few suggestions I hadn’t thought of. Things my frustrated brain was incapable of remembering.</p>
<p>I had 10 things I needed to do for my job. This whole mess was in my way. I wanted the damn internet to function so I could get back to work.</p>
<p>Thankfully her troubleshooting paid off and my internet works. Right in time to pay my rent.</p>
<p>So, while I am still unhappy with how Comcast chooses to screw over so many customers. I’m thankful there are good people working in the company who have a heart.</p>
