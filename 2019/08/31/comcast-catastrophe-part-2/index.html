                <p><img src="/img/network-cables.png" alt="Network Cables"></p>
<p>In my last post <a href="http://starcorelabs.github.io/2019/08/08/comcast-catastrophe/">Comcast Catastrophe</a> I talked about how I was angry at Comcast for trying to charge me an outrageous install fee of $70.00 to send someone out to connecting a cable. Even if I was rich I wouldn’t waste money paying pointless fees like that.</p>
<p>I was frustrated and got a bit melodramatic at the end of my last post and said I would never use Comcast again. After that I took a few days to cool off and figure out my options. I spoke with some co-workers, did internet research, and realigned my mindset.</p>
<p>I knew I could not learn anything or solve the issue while I was in a stressed and frustrated state of mind. During those 3 weeks I used my company internet and Android phone for access. So I wasn’t completely offline.</p>
<p>I looked for an alternative internet service provider in my area. ISP’s do not compete with each other. Even if there are two or more ISP’s in an area. One will always have a ridiculously better deal than the others. Like when one of your friends doesn’t want to pay a game and lets you win. Here’s a chart to illustrate my point:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">ISP</th>
<th style="text-align:left">Speed</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Monthly</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Install</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Comcast</td>
<td style="text-align:left">25Mbps</td>
<td style="text-align:center">$30.00</td>
<td style="text-align:center">$70.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">AT&amp;T</td>
<td style="text-align:left">18Mbps</td>
<td style="text-align:center">$50.00</td>
<td style="text-align:center">$0.00*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Hughesnet</td>
<td style="text-align:left">25Mbps</td>
<td style="text-align:center">$59.99</td>
<td style="text-align:center">$100.00</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These are the ISP’s and their cheapest plans in my area. Clearly my options are limited. My apartment is only wired for cable internet. So any other service provider would have a valid reason to charge me an install fee. Because they would have to run cables from the outside into my unit and then setup outlets and/or other equipment for a connection. That would be way outside my budget. So I decided I had to find a way to work with Comcast. (* My apartment doesn’t have phone jacks. AT&amp;T would have to install everything from scratch. Which would cost me more than its worth.)</p>
<p>First I had to change the way I look at Comcast. Instead of seeing it like a large monolithic company where the workers are like drones in a bee hive mindless doing what they are told. Without concern for how their actions affect their customers. Considering how badly they try to screw over their customers I can only imagine how badly they mistreat and disrespect their workers.  </p>
<p>I started thinking of Comcast as a City with many little businesses inside it all trying to work together. Some groups are happy to wave the the company flag and repeat the policies like an oath of allegiance. While other groups begrudgingly pay lip service to the company’s unsavory business practices. While doing whatever they can to help customers get what they paid for. I knew their had to be a few good individuals working in that bureaucratic bee hive.</p>
<p>With this in mind I started calling Comcast on random days to see if I could speak with people who actually care. Sure 8 out of 10 times I’d end speaking with someone who didn’t give a crap. They followed their corporate script, regurgitated the company rules, and gave me the run around. Business as usual.  </p>
<p>Through a few quick Google searches I learned that Comcast is has been sued many times in the past for fraudulent install fees. They are currently dealing with a few class action lawsuits for charging install fees, overcharging, hidden fees, and other shady business practices. There is a whole <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subreddit r/Comcast</a> filled with people venting about their horrible experiences with Comcast. They point out all the illegal things Comcast does and how to use the law to fight back.</p>
<p>This gave me a precedent to use if I needed to fill my own lawsuit against them for predatory businesses practices. Thankfully it didn’t come to that.</p>
<p>I keep calling Comcast and explaining that my equipment is already hooked up. I did a self-install so I’m not paying any extra fees.<br>After having a two different techs show up and work on the outside wires. I eventually I got a hold of a cool person who helped me sort through the companies purposefully convoluted processes to get account squared away. Because I did the installation of my equipment myself I didn’t have to pay the install fee.</p>
<p>But the problems weren’t over. Once I had it setup the service kept dropping out and resetting every 20 minutes.</p>
<p>At first I thought Comcast was doing it on purpose so they would have a reason to send out a tech to “Fix” the problem. Giving them an excuse to charge me more money.<br>After a couple of days I finally called in and spoke with an awesome tech. She was super smart and professional. She made a few suggestions I hadn’t thought of.<br>Things my frustrated brain was incapable of remembering.</p>
<p>I had 10 other things I needed to do for my job. This whole mess with Comcast was in my way. I wanted the damn internet to function so I could get back to work.</p>
<p>Thankfully her troubleshooting paid off and my internet works. Right in time to pay my rent.</p>
<p>So, while I am still unhappy with how Comcast as a company chooses to screw over so many customers. I’m thankful there are good people working in the company who have a heart.</p>
