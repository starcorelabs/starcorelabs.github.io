<p>About 3 years ago I had two streaming services, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. I rarely used Amazon Prime Video because most of the same content was already on Netflix.</p>
<p>I was on the fence of canceling both services for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was tired of the monthly service fee eating into my limited funds.</li>
<li>Netflix kept removing TV Series I was in the middle of watching because of licensing agreements.</li>
<li>Shows getting canceled due to some power play by a stuffy executive who didn’t care about the show.</li>
<li>Most of the stuff on Netflix was old movies and TV shows I had already seen.</li>
<li>70% was content I had no interest in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Around that time “Netflix Original Content” was just getting started. So naturally Netflix decided to increase their monthly service fee.</p>
<p>That was the end for me. So I canceled both subscription services. For the next month I watched YouTube videos. It worked pretty well.</p>
<p>Over time I found other free online streaming services to fill in the gaps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://pluto.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pluto TV</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch.TV</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cwtv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CWTV</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tubitv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tubi TV</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.shoutfactorytv.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shout Factory TV</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchyroll</a></li>
</ol>
<p>However, I still had a collection of Movies, Cartoons, and TV Shows on DVD and wanted an easier way to watch them without having to hunt through discs.</p>
<p>After some online research I discovered <a href="https://www.plex.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Media Server</a>. This is free software that turns an old computer into a home-based media hub. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep my Media Server as light as possible. So I decided to use <a href="https://linuxmint.com/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux Mint 19 XFCE</a> as my operating system. Linux Mint is a secure free open source operating system anyone can download and use.</p>
<p>It took me 30 minutes to install Linux Mint and another 5 minutes to install Plex Media Server on an old decommissioned desktop tower given to me from a company I previously worked for.</p>
<p>Hardware Specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>HP Pro 3130 MT</li>
<li>i3 3.20Ghz Processor</li>
<li>4GB DDR3 RAM</li>
<li>80 GB drive for the Operating System</li>
<li>4TB drive for Movies*</li>
<li>3TB drive for TV Shows*</li>
<li>320GB drive for Cartoons*</li>
</ul>
<p><small>* I added these extra drives for more storage.</small></p>
<p>Here’s a few suggestions of where you can find comparable or better hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your current company might have decommissioned desktops they send to recycling. It won’t hurt to ask if they would be willing to give or sell one to you.</li>
<li>Small local computer repair and/or surplus shops near you. You might find a used tower for a decent price.</li>
<li>If you’re lucky enough to live near a <a href="https://www.frys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fry’s</a> check out their online and in-store deals.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eBay</a> - As with any online purchase make sure to verify you’re dealing with a reputable seller. eBay is where I go to price check used hardware.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Craigslist</a> - Follow the site guidelines to avoid scams. You might find a good deal.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Marketplace</a> - While I don’t like Facebook. I’ve had good luck buying locally from their Market Place.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newegg</a> - Check out the deals on Newegg.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiger Direct</a> - Tiger Direct has great sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the system was ready I used <a href="https://handbrake.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Handbrake</a> to copy my DVD’s to digital video files. Following the <a href="https://support.plex.tv/articles/categories/media-preparation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Media Preparation Guide</a> I sorted and named all my video files into the proper folders so Plex could see and play them.</p>
<p>Inside Plex I setup libraries for my files. Then Plex automatically found the video descriptions and posters to display for each title. Giving me a similar experience to Netflix.</p>
<p>It might seem like a lot of work to set up a Plex Media Server. Actually, it was fast and easy. Copying video files to the system and naming them correctly was the only time-consuming part. But it wasn’t difficult.</p>
<p>I cannot overstate the benefits of setting up a Plex Media Server:</p>
<ul>
<li>I own the content so its not going to disappear in a month.</li>
<li>The only cost is the hardware (and a bit of electricity) because all the software I’m using is free.</li>
<li>I have complete control over the hardware and software, what content I want to add, and who has access to it.</li>
<li>Even if my internet goes down for some reason I can still access my Plex Media Server. No streaming service currently offers anything like that.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those of you who want a video how-two guide. Here’s two in-depth YouTube videos showing how to install Plex Media Server and configure it on Windows.</p>

</ol>
<p>Before you embark on building your own Plex Media Server. You’ll need to decide on how much you want to invest in the project. What kind of operating system you want to run, Windows or Linux. (whatever is more comfortable for you)</p>
<p>Then you’ll need to consider the kind of content you want to add and who will have access to it. Once you’ve mapped out your project you’ll be ready to build it.</p>
<p>If you have questions there is a great community on the <a href="https://forums.plex.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Forums</a> and you can usually find a YouTube video that will help.</p>
<p>I hope you like using your Plex Media Server as much I like mine.</p>
