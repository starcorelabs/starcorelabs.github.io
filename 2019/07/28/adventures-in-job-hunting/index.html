                <p>I want to tell you a true story of intrigue, conflict, loss, searching, rejection, mystery, and finally success.</p>
<p>After considering writing out a detailed account of the last 2 years. I realized the roller coaster ride of complex events and my interactions would take too long to explain. The subtleties and nuances of my technical profession and the often murky world of corporate hierarchy would be lost in translation and confuse most people. Even people who work in the field. This is one of those situations where you’d have to have lived through it to fully appreciate the “Stranger Than Fiction” aspect of it all.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-main-point"><a href="#What-is-the-main-point" class="headerlink" title="What is the main point?"></a>What is the main point?</h5><p>Technology and the Front-End Development field changes at such a rapid rate that if you’re not constantly learning the latest techniques and frameworks you’ll quickly fall behind and become obsolete.</p>
<p>At the same time, regardless of your skills, if you don’t have a solid network of professional contacts you’ll have a hard time finding a job.</p>
<h5 id="An-Introvert’s-Opinion"><a href="#An-Introvert’s-Opinion" class="headerlink" title="An Introvert’s Opinion"></a>An Introvert’s Opinion</h5><p>The field is dominated by extroverts who are constantly posting on their websites or LinkedIn about how amazing they are or the latest project they accomplished. Its all a bit too much back-patting and self-aggrandizement to me.</p>
<p>In my opinion and experience the best developers are busy improving their skills and solving problems. They are not trying to gain followers on social media or to sell yet another book or how-to course. Whatever happened to doing your job and minding your own business?</p>
<h5 id="Adventure-Summary"><a href="#Adventure-Summary" class="headerlink" title="Adventure Summary"></a>Adventure Summary</h5><p>After 2 years of job hunting. Dealing with shady gate keeping recruiters and corporations requiring bachelor degrees for jobs that don’t use them. I was extremely lucky and found a great job working for an awesome company. My manager and co-workers are are smart, talented, and cool laid-back people. I am beyond grateful to be working at such a great company as a full-time employee.</p>
<p>Its been a long strange road getting here. Like a solider who’s been through combat. The last 2 years have left me a bit shell shocked. Being lied to, jerked around, and ghosted on by non-technical recruiters. Having strained interactions with family, friends, and associates who could not understand my struggle of not knowing weather I’d be able to pay my rent and eat next week. It has left me with some trust issues and anxiety.</p>
<p>On top of that I spent most of the last 2 years by myself. Being alone that long has had strange effects on me. My people skills are rusty. Don’t get me wrong. I like people and want to connect with them. But I can only do that in small doses before my social batteries wear out.</p>
<p>There are some really amazing and interesting people at my new job. I’m hoping to learn a lot from them. But, I’m taking my time getting to know them. Doing my best not to offend or annoy them. Keeping in mind the main reason I’m working there is to write code and solve problems.</p>
<p>Its a juggling act and I’m working hard to find a balance.</p>
<p>As of this post I’ve worked there for 2 weeks. I plan on working there for as long as possible. While continuing to improve my skills and build a solid network of colleagues that help each other.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the opportunity to get back to work.</p>
