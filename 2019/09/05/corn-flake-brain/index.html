                <p><img src="/img/corn-flakes-in-bowl.jpg" alt="Corn Flake Bowl"></p>
<p>Monday night, 09/02, I did something innocent but stupid. I ate bowl of corn flakes with cashew milk. It messed me up for two days.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain. I have <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322744.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hypoglycemia</a>. In simple terms it means I’m allergic to sugar, especially refined sugar, and specific types of carbohydrates. My body doesn’t process them correctly and it causes me all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>I’m usually very good about sticking to my “Safe Foods List”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beef - Hamburger, steak, or chili</li>
<li>Chicken - Buffalo chicken wings</li>
<li>Ham - Not honey ham or bacon</li>
<li>Turkey - Roasted or deep fried</li>
<li>Green Beans</li>
<li>Black Beans</li>
<li>Chick Peas</li>
<li>Lettuce</li>
<li>Tomato</li>
<li>Spinach - Fresh not canned</li>
<li>Strawberries &amp; Raspberries</li>
<li>Mexican Food - Beef and Bean Chimichanga, Beef or Chicken Tacos.  </li>
<li>Mild or Hot Salsa</li>
<li>Chinese Food - Chicken Egg Rolls, Chicken on a Stick,</li>
<li>Indian Food - Chilli Chicken, Chana Masala, with plain Naan Bread.</li>
<li>Cheerios</li>
<li>Cashew Milk</li>
<li>Distilled Water</li>
<li>Rooibos Herbal Tea</li>
<li>Maruchan Brand Chicken Flavored Ramon Noodles</li>
<li>Flavored Seltzer Water - without sugar, caffeine, citric acid, or other additives</li>
</ul>
<p><small>Note: I avoid anything with more than 3mg of sugar on the label. As well as anything made with sugar, high fructose corn syrup, maple syrup, sorghum, molasses, sucralose, maltodextrin, stevia, alcohol sugars, honey, fruit sugars, or any other artificial sweeteners.</small></p>
<p><small>I avoid bread, cow’s milk, cheese, and do not drink alcohol.</small></p>
<p><small>I don’t eat seafood of any kind because I don’t like it.</small></p>
<hr>
<p>There are rare days when I’m tired, busy, distracted, and/or forget to stick to the list. When that happens I pay for it hard.</p>
<p>This was one of those days.</p>
<p>I’ve been eating Cheerios for the last month with no ill effects. So when I bought a box of Corn Flakes I had no idea it would affect me this badly.</p>
<h4 id="Monday-09-02"><a href="#Monday-09-02" class="headerlink" title="Monday 09/02"></a>Monday 09/02</h4><p>It was labor day and I planned on using this extra day off to improve my developer skills. While watching a coding training course on YouTube I wanted something different to snack on. So I made myself a bowl of corn flakes and continued to watch videos without knowing the pain I was setting myself up for.</p>
<p>An hour after I finished the bowl of Corn Flakes I started feeling bad. My body started to hurt all over. Like the start of a bad cold or flu. My brain went all foggy. Making it hard to focus and think clearly. I became severely lethargic. As if I’d just eaten a big Thanksgiving Day meal.</p>
<p>Then I started getting a bad headache.</p>
<p>If you’ve read my previous posts you’ll know during this time I was very distracted while fighting with my modem, router, and ISP attempting to fix intermittent connectivity issues with my internet.</p>
<p>I chalked up my growing physical pains to stress and frustration over my Internet issues.</p>
<p>A couple hours after I ate the bowl of Corn Flakes I felt horrible. I had stayed up too late fighting with my Internet. Growing more irritated and angry.</p>
<p>So I decided to prepare for work on Tuesday and then go to bed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my headache turned into a migraine. The extra natural sugar in the Corn Flakes kept me wired so I couldn’t fall asleep.</p>
<p>Instead of getting a full nights rest and feeling refreshed. I was exhausted, foggy brained, all my muscles hurt from too much sugar in my blood, and I was still frustrated with my Internet issues.</p>
<h4 id="Tuesday-09-03"><a href="#Tuesday-09-03" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday 09/03"></a>Tuesday 09/03</h4><p>My migraine had become so bad that light and sound hurt. But I got up and started to get ready for work. When I tried to go to the kitchen and make something to eat I got really dizzy. That’s when I knew I had to take the day off and stay home.</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know. I am a workaholic. I love what I do and I’m happiest when I’m working. So staying home from work is not fun for me. I don’t like feeling behind on projects.</p>
<p>I sent an email saying I was taking PTO and then turned off my work laptop. The Internet at my apartment is so unstable its worthless to try and use it for more than 10 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>I laid back down and eventually sometime around 11:00am I fell asleep. It was only for a few hours but it helped.</p>
<p>I still wasn’t back to what I call “Normal”. Now my left ear was stopped up and my back hurt from laying down too long.</p>
<p>I tried to do some work but the light from my laptop screen hurt my eyes so I ended up cleaning my apartment.</p>
<p>Eventually the day ended and I tried to get some more sleep. Didn’t sleep much Tuesday night either.</p>
<h4 id="Wednesday-09-04"><a href="#Wednesday-09-04" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday 09/04"></a>Wednesday 09/04</h4><p>I was about 40% operational. My headache was still present but not blinding anymore. My kidneys hurt for some strange reason. But, I was better enough to go back to work.</p>
<p>I struggled to stay focused through out the day because my brain was in a fog. I had a project meeting at 9:30am and did my best to pay attention and answer questions when asked. They seemed to accept whatever incoherent babble fell out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I did my best to avoid interactions that required me to speak. I like my co-works and enjoy talking with them when I’m functional. I do not want them to think I’ve lost my mind or that I’m having a stroke. When I’ve got foggy brain its hard to think or talk. Words hard when brain not go.</p>
<p>Did I mention I felt terrible all day? I somehow managed to complete a ticket I’d been working on for a while. I was happy for about 3 seconds.<br>The unrelenting pain in my body reminded me of the ass kicking I was getting from a single bowl of damn Corn Flakes. Sugar is poison to me.</p>
<p>Slowly toward the end of the day I started feeling better. But foggy brain wasn’t done messing with me.</p>
<p>My manager was talking with a fellow co-worker. He said something about WordPress being open source.</p>
<p>Of course normally I know this to be true. Its one of the top reasons I like WordPress. Somehow in my pain filled foggy brain I connected WordPress with Squarespace. Which is an online brochure website application. To my knowledge it is not open source. Under the hood they might use some open source technologies but they don’t share their code.</p>
<p>Stupid foggy brain took over and disagreed with my manager that WordPress was open source. Again mouth was saying WordPress but foggy brain was visualizing the Squarespace website.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until after work when I got out to my car that the wires untangled and I realized the false connection I was making. WordPress is open source. Squarespace is not. What the hell was I thinking?!</p>
<p>Thankfully my manager is a cool guy and wrote it off to me being uninformed or having a case of “The Dumb”.</p>
<p>I went home and after another hour I could think clearly again. I went through all the things I’d eaten that might have caused this horrible 48 hours of pain. As soon as I realized it was the Corn Flakes I put on my shoes and took what was left in the box to the dumpster. That stuff is gone.</p>
<p>This is yet another painful lesson in a long line why I stick to my “Safe Foods List”.</p>
<h4 id="Unsolicited-Advice"><a href="#Unsolicited-Advice" class="headerlink" title="Unsolicited Advice"></a>Unsolicited Advice</h4><p>For years when some individuals found out that I cannot eat sweets they take it on themselves to try and fix me. Offering me unsolicited advice.</p>
<p>As if over the last 10 years I’ve never spoken to doctors, researched, or tested alternatives? My “Safe Foods List” was born from years of trial and painful error.</p>
<p>Those same people refuse to listen when I tell them, “No thanks, I’ve adapted and don’t crave sugary foods”. Its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhXjcZdk5QQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inconceivable</a> to them that I don’t want it.  </p>
<p>I use to wonder why my dietary issues bothered them so much? Some might be coming from a place of trying to help. But others clearly have an insecure need to be right about everything.</p>
<p>To those people I usually say. If you’re not a licensed medical professional with years of experience treating patients with blood sugar issues, please don’t offer me suggestions or advice. You don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Doctors have told me if I force myself to eat sugary foods it could cause more damage and risk my health getting worse. I don’t want to become diabetic and have to pay for insulin pills or take injections just to function. My dietary restrictions don’t have any affect on what you can or cannot eat. I’m not judging you. Go nuts.</p>
<p>I’ve had enough pain recently. I’ll stick to my “Safe Foods List”, thank you.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if you have blood sugar issues be careful what you eat. If you don’t be thankful and enjoy yourself.  </p>
