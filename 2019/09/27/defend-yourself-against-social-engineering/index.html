                <p><img src="/img/gears.jpg" alt="Gears"></p>
<p>In this this article I’ll cover how Social Engineering happens everyday outside the workplace between family, friends, and associates. How to detect when its being used on you and the steps you can take to defeat it and protect yourself.</p>
<p>Everything I’ve written here comes from personal experiences and 10+ years of studying sales, marketing, persuasion, hypnotherapy, and social engineering.</p>
<h4 id="So-what-is-Social-Engineering"><a href="#So-what-is-Social-Engineering" class="headerlink" title="So what is Social Engineering?"></a>So what is Social Engineering?</h4><p>The technical definition is, “The use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes.”</p>
<p>My definition is, “The use of any tactic to deceive and manipulate a person or group into giving away information, resources, or money for free.”</p>
<p>Social Engineers come in many varieties. Some are simply immature people looking to get their way to feel powerful. Some are users looking to get something for nothing. A small percentage are intelligent people with personality disorders and the intent to use your weakness against you for their own gain. For simplicity, within this article I’ll refer to all these people as scammers.</p>
<p>Personal power is a seriously misunderstood concept. It simply boils down to choice. You have the power to choose whom you listen to and what actions you take. People only have the power you give them. It doesn’t matter if they are 8 years old or 80. It doesn’t matter if they are family, friends, or a stranger. It doesn’t matter how old you are, what you look like, or if you’re a man or woman (or other).</p>
<p>You are in control of your time, money, and things. Unless someone beats you up and takes your stuff. You don’t have to share any of your resources with anyone. You don’t have to take on other people problems. You have the power to choose. Keep your power for yourself. Anyone who tries to convince you that you have no choice is a scammer.</p>
<p>Some scammers say, “Your life is not your own.” This is an attempt to emotionally manipulate you. When this assertion is examined logically it makes no sense. If you’re and adult living in any modern free country, then your life is your own.</p>
<p>There is an old saying, “If your cup is empty. You cannot give others a drink”. Most would agree it is good to be helpful. But, don’t help other people to the point that it hurts you. Or, allow other people to take advantage of your kindness. There are scammers who see your kindness as weakness and will try to use it against you to get something for nothing without regard for how it hurts you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Givers have to set limits because takers never do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take care of your needs and fill your cup first. Then you can choose how and when you give help to others, if at all.</p>
<p>Mature people are usually focused on working, paying their bills, being self-sufficient and self-sustaining. While immature people are always complaining about their problems and trying to use others to get “Something For Nothing”. It is easy to see these distinct patterns of behavior over years.</p>
<p>Regardless of what kind of scammer you are dealing with. They all use a small number of similar tactics to achieve their goals. Once you know what to look for you’ll be less likely to fall victim to their scams.</p>
<p>However, before I explain what those tactics are. If you are dealing with someone who you suspect or know has a personality disorder. Never let your guard down. Never give in to their demands or assume you can change them. Like a stray cat begging at the door. If you give in once they will feel they have control over you. They see you as a resource they can exploit. They will relentlessly hound, threaten, discredit you, and possibility become violent, until you give them what they want. Or, even after you give in. (Depending on their disorder)</p>
<p>People with personality disorders see no benefit in changing their behavior. They don’t feel regret or remorse for how they use and hurt people. They don’t care if they destroy relationships or even if they ruin lives. The are impatient, entitled, and only concerned with getting what they want. If you get in their way they will retaliate and hurt you directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>The best way to win is to never play their game. Avoid them altogether if possible. If not, audio and/or video record all interactions with them. So they cannot play word games, use logical fallacies and/or twist your words to play the victim and cause you social or legal trouble later.</p>
<h4 id="Sales"><a href="#Sales" class="headerlink" title="Sales"></a>Sales</h4><p>Take any sales training course and you’ll hear this common phrase, “People buy emotionally and justify rationally”. What sales people understand is to persuade people to take action and buy something. You have to move their emotions first. Sales people are some of the best Social Engineers because their livelihood depends on changing people’s minds.</p>
<p>There are countless movies and TV shows that demonstrate how sales and marketing professionals run an advertisement that convinces people to buy a product. Later they are hailed as heroes for it. This glamorizing of Social Engineering only makes it more ingrained in our culture as a common and harmless activity. Don’t be fooled. Any modern sales course will teach you the tactics used to influence people to change their minds and take action. You’ll find similarities to the tactics described below.</p>
<h4 id="Target-Areas"><a href="#Target-Areas" class="headerlink" title="Target Areas"></a>Target Areas</h4><p>Scammers look for weakness in your emotions and ability to think logically. </p>
<ol>
<li>Pain Points - Problems people are experiencing that can be used against them.</li>
<li>Cognitive Load - The weight and effort of deep thinking.</li>
<li>Cognitive Bias - Your resistance to changing your pattern of thinking.</li>
<li>Logical Fallacies - How your emotions can trick you into believing bullshit.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Scammer-Tactics"><a href="#Scammer-Tactics" class="headerlink" title="Scammer Tactics"></a>Scammer Tactics</h4><p>All the tactics scammers use can be broken down into 3 categories. When dealing with these people and their attempts to use you. Keep asking yourself, “What do they really want?” Never take what they say at face value. Always double check and verify they are telling the truth.</p>
<ol>
<li>Love Bomb - Like a friend or lover who comes buttering you up. Being overly nice. Trying to make you feel happy, special, or great. This tactic is a setup so they can indirectly or directly ask for something, hoping to get it for nothing. Without any concern for repaying your kindness or generosity.</li>
<li>Sob Story - They will play the victim trying to use your empathy against you. They are more concerned about you believing them and taking their side against whomever didn’t give them their way. Because they don’t want to fix the problem or feel better. They want to build an army and launch an attack to destroy their target. Sometimes they will play the victim to make you feel sorry for them so you’ll give into their requests. Again, getting something for nothing.</li>
<li>Bully - The mask is off and their true colors are revealed. You see them as the self-centered, uncaring bully they are. They will make demands for what they want. Threatening violence or threatening to lie to hurt you or to publicly shame you. All of this bravado and bluster is a carefully constructed act. They are trying to scare you into giving them something for nothing.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>It is an attempt to trick you into thinking you don’t have a choice and you should bow down and be afraid. Because if they get mad they will throw a fit, scream, and possibly hurt you. The best defense is to stay calm, don’t show any fear, and don’t play into the stage act they are putting on. They know most of their threats are empty.</p>
<p>Its like a poker game and they are bluffing with a bad hand. Don’t believe it. Call them on their bluff. If they’ve threatened you, call the authorities yourself.</p>
<p>In those moments when they are throwing a fit and making demands. Calmly give them 2 or 3 choices that work for you. If they keep making demands and threats against you. Start taking choices away. Again the best choice for you is to avoid these kinds of people at all cost. Highly trained professionals with years of experience struggle to manage and correct these people’s destructive behavior patterns.</p>
<p>It is a misguided dream to believe that being kind, understanding, compassionate, and loving will give them an example of the best way to interact with others. Those qualities take time and effort to develop. People with personality disorders are impatient and lack the physical wiring in their brains to create feelings of understanding and empathy. They are incapable of feeling love or caring if they hurt other people. (Learn more by reading about Mirror Neurons)</p>
<p>In fact, most of them set out to annoy, irritate, and/or hurt people emotionally because it puts their target off balance. When we are off balance we are wrapped up in our hurt feelings and not paying attention to the details. Scammers they take advantage of our confusion and hurt to get something for nothing.</p>
<p>Also, hurting someone through acting tough or saying mean words makes scammers feel powerful. Which is something they desperately need, like a drug. Not complying with their request, not getting hurt, angry, or reacting emotionally to their threats is the best repellent. Most scammers are usually impatient and when their strategies fail they are left feeling weak, confused, and lost. These feelings, more than anything you say, will convince them to leave you alone and look for another target. They don’t want a fight. They want an easy to use resource.</p>
<p>Keep your power for yourself. Remember you always have a choice of how to spend your time and resources. Do not change yourself to keep the peace or please others. Especially when dealing with scammers who only care about getting what they want.</p>
<p>Last, the best method when dealing with scammers is to go “no contact”, if you can. Cut all ties and do not interact with them at all.<br>They will eventually get bored and move on.</p>
