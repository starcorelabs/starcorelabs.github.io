<h2 id="Documentation-for-Comcast-Support"><a href="#Documentation-for-Comcast-Support" class="headerlink" title="Documentation for Comcast Support"></a>Documentation for Comcast Support</h2><p>I wrote this post to track my interactions with Comcast. I only wish I would have thought about doing this sooner.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ve missed a few interactions. But the overall pattern is the same with each call. I’m tired of repeating myself so the next time I have to talk with a tech I’ll give them a link to this post.</p>
<p>Internally they don’t take good notes or talk with each other because most are callous and don’t care.</p>
<p>Also, I want them to know whom they are dealing with. I’m not a typical non-technical customer. They won’t confuse, intimidate, or give me ultimatums. I want the service they advertised on their website.</p>

<h4 id="Side-Notes"><a href="#Side-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Side Notes"></a>Side Notes</h4><ul>
<li>Comcast’s “Performance Starter” says, “Free Self-Install Kit” on their website. Its rated at 25 Mbps down for $20.00 a month. ($30.00 a month for the first 45 days)</li>
<li>But, you have to sign-up for paperless billing and autopay. Otherwise it’s $30.00 a month.</li>
<li>Even though it says “Free Self-Install Kit” I was told I’d have to pay a $70.00 install fee.</li>
<li>Forbes reported Comcast had $86 billion in revenues in 2018, and earnings of over $11 billion. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/12/04/what-are-comcasts-key-revenue-drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/12/04/what-are-comcasts-key-revenue-drivers/</a><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>With $86 billion in revenue they don’t need that $70.00 install fee. I refuse to pay for something that was advertised as “Free”. Stop being greedy.</p>
<p>All I want is for Comcast to be honest and change the offer on the website. Be upfront that it requires a $50.00 deposit or credit check. Tell me on the website there is a $70.00 install fee. Point out that it is $30.00 a month not $20. Then I won’t complain. I’m sick of being lied to. Just be honest about how badly your trying screw me out of my money so I can decide if it’s worth it or not.</p>

<li>Got a new job and moved to a new apartment.</li>
<li>I wanted basic Internet since I’m spending most of my time at work. There is no point in overpaying for a service I’m only going to use a couple hours a day.</li>
<li>I choose Comcast’s “Performance Starter”. Which says, “Free Self-Install Kit” on their website. Its rated at 25Mbps down for $20.00 a month. But you have to sign-up for paperless billing and autopay. Otherwise it’s $30.00 a month.</li>
<li>Called Comcast to setup Internet. Spoke with Lydia and she said my apartment wasn’t provisioned for Internet. Said it might not be possible for me to get internet.</li>
<li>She said I would have to wait 6 days for a tech to come to my apartment and there would be $70.00 install fee.</li>
<li>She said its because this unit hasn’t had service for the last 6 months.</li>
<li>Had service in my last apartment for 6 years and never heard anything like this before.</li>
<li>Told her I refused to pay any install fee. Because on their website it says, “Free Self-Install Kit”. I asked her why is Comcast offering “Free Self-Install Kit” and then trying to charge me. The cables are already in place. My equipment is already hooked up. What are you installing? I’m not paying $70.00 for someone to connect a wire. That’s a waste of money.</li>
<li>Lydia ignored me and said that they’d have to do a credit check before I would be approved for the service, or I could pay a deposit of $50.00 to avoid it. I pointed out I’d previously had Comcast for 6 years. I turned it off for 30 days because I had to move and was waiting for my new apartment to be available.</li>
<li>She kept trying to confuse me with conflicting numbers and technical terms. I kept refusing to agree to any fees.</li>
<li>Finally she transferred me to Jerome without explaining anything we talked about. I told him I wanted what was advertised on the website. The Performance Starter for $20.00 a month with the “Free Install Kit”. I told him I refused to pay any install fees. He told me I didn’t have a choice. Which infuriated me. I told him I always have a choice. I can use another service or go without the internet completely.</li>
<li>I hung up and went without the internet for a couple of weeks while looking for other options.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-13th-Tuesday"><a href="#August-13th-Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="August 13th Tuesday"></a>August 13th Tuesday</h4><ul>
<li>Eventually I decided to try Comcast again hoping they would honor their online advertising and give me a basic serve at a reasonable rate. Without fraudulent install and service fees being added on.</li>
<li>I got a call from Jeff and talked with him about the situation. He said he could talk with his superior about offering me a “Comcast Gift Card” with $70.00 on it to counteract the install fee.</li>
<li>I asked why not cut out the middleman and just waive the fee?</li>
<li>He said he wasn’t not authorized to do that.</li>
<li>I asked to be transferred to someone who was authorized.</li>
<li>He said a supervisor would call me back in 30 minutes. No one called me back.</li>
<li>I started doing research on Comcast’s business practices.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/Comcast</a> is a forum for all the horrible things Comcast has done to their customers out of greed. It’s a great source for tracking all the lawsuits against Comcast for illegal fees. I especially like all the documentation showing the lawsuit Comcast has lost which sets a precedent. Which I will use to win my own lawsuit if Comcast keep trying to screw me out of $70.00 to connect a wire.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-16th-Friday"><a href="#August-16th-Friday" class="headerlink" title="August 16th Friday"></a>August 16th Friday</h4><ul>
<li>Called Comcast again and spoke with Joel.</li>
<li>He said he could send me the Comcast gift card with $70.00 to cover the install fee.</li>
<li>I told Joel to keep the card and just waive the fee. He said he wasn’t authorized to do that.</li>
<li>I told him I wasn’t happy about the autopay requirement for the service. I said I didn’t want Comcast to have access to my bank account because they have tried to overcharge me in the past.</li>
<li>He suggested using a prepaid card. Which I thought was a good idea.</li>
<li>Frustrated with how much time I’ve wasted on this I told him to schedule a tech to come out and setup my service. But, I wasn’t going to pay the install fee.</li>
<li>He said OK and said someone would come out on the 20th between 10:00 am and 4:00pm.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-20th-Tuesday"><a href="#August-20th-Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="August 20th Tuesday"></a>August 20th Tuesday</h4><ul>
<li>I had asked my manager on Monday the 19th if I could work from home on the 20th to be available for the Comcast tech. He said no problem.</li>
<li>1st Tech “Ross” came at 8:30 am.</li>
<li>He had an attitude and was rude to me in my apartment.</li>
<li>I told him to watch his tone with me.</li>
<li>He was unable to setup the service. He acted like being here was a waste of his time.</li>
<li>He told me it was a wiring issue and he’d have to schedule a wiring team to fix it.</li>
<li>He called Comcast’s technician line and setup an appointment for the next day.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-21st-Wednesday"><a href="#August-21st-Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="August 21st  Wednesday"></a>August 21st  Wednesday</h4><ul>
<li>2nd Tech “Bill” came and setup the wiring.</li>
<li>He said the 1st tech connected the wrong wires together in the box on the outside.</li>
<li>He replaced the wall jack and wiring.</li>
<li>Rewired the splitter to go directly to my jack.</li>
<li>He called Comcast’s technician line to validate the mac address of my modem.</li>
<li>He ran tests and found the service was working OK.</li>
<li>Power cycled the modem and router (CTSSR).</li>
<li>My modem keep resetting over and over.</li>
<li>Bill said it would quit on its own.</li>
<li>An hour after he left the Internet stopped working.</li>
<li>I downloaded the Comcast “My Account” app on my Android phone to send a reset signal to my modem. It worked.</li>
<li>The service was up for an hour and then reset my modem again.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-24th-Saturday"><a href="#August-24th-Saturday" class="headerlink" title="August 24th Saturday"></a>August 24th Saturday</h4><ul>
<li>Got tired of resetting my service every 30 minutes to an hour and called Comcast tech support. Had to fight the automated voice system to get to a live tech.</li>
<li>Spoke with “Joel” who checked my account and found that it was still in a pending status.</li>
<li>He said the system might be sending a reset signal because no one finalized the install. I told him I setup the equipment myself. He said since I did a “self-install” he would waive the install fee.</li>
<li>He changed the status of my account to “Active”.</li>
<li>We power cycled and reset my modem again.</li>
<li>The service seemed to be working better.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-26th-Monday"><a href="#August-26th-Monday" class="headerlink" title="August 26th Monday"></a>August 26th Monday</h4><ul>
<li>After a long day at work I came home to watch a few YouTube videos and write in a post for this blog.</li>
<li>The Internet was out again.</li>
<li>Checked on my phone to see if there were any outages in the area. None.</li>
<li>Power cycled my modem. Then sent a reset signal through the Comcast “My Account” app. It reset and the Internet came back up.</li>
<li>After 30 minutes the internet went out again.</li>
<li>Used the Comcast “My Account” app to do another reset.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes the internet came back and lasted for an hour.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-29th-Thursday"><a href="#August-29th-Thursday" class="headerlink" title="August 29th Thursday"></a>August 29th Thursday</h4><ul>
<li>Was frustrated with having to reset the internet every hour. Called Comcast support to fix the issue.</li>
<li>Spoke with someone in sales who transferred me to an awesome tech who went above and beyond to help me.</li>
<li>She advised me to reset my Modem back to factory default.</li>
<li>It seemed to help and the Internet worked for over 2 hours.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-30th-Friday-My-Birthday"><a href="#August-30th-Friday-My-Birthday" class="headerlink" title="August 30th Friday (My Birthday)"></a>August 30th Friday (My Birthday)</h4><ul>
<li>Again I had to power cycle and reset my modem about 10 times.</li>
<li>Spent most of the day fighting with my router.</li>
<li>I removed my router and directly plugged into the modem to see if it would help.</li>
<li>The Internet was connected for 2 hours and then cut off again.</li>
<li>I dreaded calling Comcast Tech Support because they always do the same thing over and over without resolving the issue. (CTSSR)</li>
<li>I put up with the intermittent connectivity because I have other things to do with my time.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="September-2nd-Monday-Labor-Day"><a href="#September-2nd-Monday-Labor-Day" class="headerlink" title="September 2nd Monday (Labor Day)"></a>September 2nd Monday (Labor Day)</h4><ul>
<li>Called Technical Support and fought past the automated voice system.</li>
<li>Spoke with Kate for about 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Explained the intermittent connectivity.</li>
<li>Told her my modem has been reset to factory default.</li>
<li>Explained that I’m on a Desktop computer connected through an Ethernet wire directly to my modem. (Surfboard SB6121)</li>
<li>She ran through the Comcast Tech Standard Routine.</li>
<li>Then tried to get me to agree to having a tech come out to my apartment on Wednesday.</li>
<li>I told her I will agree to a tech coming out but I refuse to agree to any fees or charges.</li>
<li>She ignored me and sent me an email that said “$70.00 install fee”. Which is utter garbage.</li>
<li>I told her I refuse to pay an install fee for something that is already setup. Plus the ad on the website said it was “Free Self-Install”.</li>
<li>She said that she would waive the install fee but kept mumbling about something I couldn’t quite hear.</li>
<li>She told me to click the link in the email and agree to it so she could schedule a tech.</li>
<li>I told her I refuse to agree to anything with a fee or charge.</li>
<li>I asked her to send me another email that, in writing, said that all fees are waived.</li>
<li>She said that once the tech comes out and see that the problem is with Comcast’s service he’ll report back to the office and the fee will be waived. Which will show up on my next bill. In other words, I’ll pay the fee now and then they’ll credit my account later.</li>
<li>I asked her how often does the tech admit that its Comcast’s fault the service isn’t working? She didn’t answer.</li>
<li>I asked to speak with someone who had the power to send me valid documentation stating that I wouldn’t be charged any fees if a tech comes out to check my connection.</li>
<li>She transferred me to someone in the “Customer Solutions” department without telling him anything.</li>
<li>I asked Jerico to read the notes Kate left. They were sparse and didn’t explain anything.</li>
<li>I had to explain everything again. Jerico looked at my account and said, “Sir your location hasn’t had service in the last 6 months”. Frustrated with this same old song and dance I cut him off.</li>
<li>I said, “That doesn’t matter. That’s a bullshit rule the company made up. It’s just a ploy to sucker dumb people into paying more for something you claim on your website is free. Stop with the games. I want the service you advertised on your website. I refuse to pay for an install fee. Just fix it so it stops resetting my modem”.</li>
<li>Jerico tried repeatedly to read from his script and over-explain how it works. Like a robot following his programming. I kept refusing to agree to any fees. Calling bullshit on the “Rules”.</li>
<li>I told him I know he’s just doing his job.</li>
<li>I asked him if someone offered him something for free and then turned around and tried to charge him for it would he accept it?</li>
<li>He didn’t answer my question. Instead said he’s sorry for my frustration and the situation. (I’ve worked in call centers for years. That false sympathy routine doesn’t work on me).</li>
<li>He kept harping on the fact that he had to send someone out and I’d have to agree to the fee before he could do that. I repeatedly refused to agree to any fees.</li>
<li>I asked him to transfer me to a supervisor who can waive the fees and schedule a tech to fix the service.</li>
<li>He happily transferred me to D.J without telling him anything about my situation.</li>
<li>D.J. was quiet and seemed distracted. I’ve worked with techs like him before. They know most people don’t like silence on the phone.</li>
<li>He was paying more attention to something else, probably texting on his phone. It was obvious from his disinterested tone that he didn’t care one way or the other what my problem was or what I said.</li>
<li>He tried to run me through the (CTSSR).</li>
<li>I asked him to wait and listen to my unusual situation first.</li>
<li>I gave him a brief summary of the intermittent connectivity issues, modem resets, and the runaround I’ve been getting from techs.</li>
<li>He waited quietly and then said he had to run me through the Comcast Tech Support Standard Routine.</li>
<li>After that he said the service looks good without errors on his end.</li>
<li>He said if I had more intermittent connectivity issues they would have to send out a tech and charge me. Because it was most likely my modem causing the issue. (Business as Usual)</li>
<li>Then he went silent. As if the silence would bother me. I assume he was texting someone.</li>
<li>I ask him to name 3 brands of modems that are Comcast compatible. After a minute he replied:<ul>
<li>Netgear c700</li>
<li>Cisco T1682G</li>
<li>Anything from Bestbuy that is Docsis 3.0 should be Comcast compatible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I told him I would rather spend $70.00 on a new Modem I own than pay an install fee.</li>
<li>Knowing the answer to be “YES”. I asked him if I got a new modem would I need to call in and provide the Mac address to have it provisioned. He said, “NO. Either he lied to me, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, or he doesn’t care.</li>
<li>More silence. Then he said he could schedule a tech to come out.</li>
<li>I ask if he could waive the install fee. He said no. More silence.</li>
<li>I asked if I could speak with a supervisor (this is the 3rd time I’ve asked for as supervisor in the last hour.)<br>He said I would have to wait 20 minutes for one to call me back. It was 9:30pm.</li>
<li>I told him I would call back at a later time.</li>
<li>He said OK and hung up.</li>
<li>20 minutes later my internet reset again.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m tired and going to bed. I’ll keep updating this specific post with new interactions as they happen.</p>
<h4 id="September-4th-Wednesday"><a href="#September-4th-Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="September 4th Wednesday"></a>September 4th Wednesday</h4><p>5:30pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Home from work. Tried to watch a short 5 minute YouTube video. Internet connection is down. Fail.</li>
<li>Power Cycled my modem. Reconnected for 5 minutes then failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>5:45pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Used Comcast App on Android phone to send reset signal. Waited 3 minutes. Connection restored.</li>
<li>When to the store for groceries.</li>
</ul>
<p>6:30pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Back from the store. Checked internet connection. Online.</li>
<li>Checked email. Then tried to watch a 12 minute YouTube video. Got half-way through it and video started buffering. Felt rage swelling. Then reconnected and was able to finish the video.</li>
<li>Made food and cleaned kitchen.</li>
</ul>
<p>7:00pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Modem lost signal and reset on its own. Reconnected.</li>
</ul>
<p>7:30pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Lost connection again. Waiting to see if it will reconnect on its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>7:40pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Used Comcast App on Android phone to reset connection for the nth time.</li>
<li>Connection restored… but for how long?!</li>
</ul>
<p>7:55pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection down again.</li>
<li>Tired of fighting with the signal.</li>
<li>Don’t want to waste time calling tech support because they just want me to pay $70.00 for a tech to come out. Without any guarantee they will fix the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>8:00pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection reset itself. Back online.</li>
<li>Only for one minute. Then back offline again.</li>
</ul>
<p>8:13pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection is back. I don’t trust it.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="September-6th-Friday"><a href="#September-6th-Friday" class="headerlink" title="September 6th Friday"></a>September 6th Friday</h4><p>6:00pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Tried to watch Twitch.tv</li>
<li>Was able to watch 30 mins before the network disconnected</li>
<li>Ran a reset from my Android app</li>
<li>Reset for a minute then went down again</li>
<li>Called Comcast tech support</li>
<li>Got automated voice system</li>
<li>Forced me to do a power cycle</li>
<li>Also ran another reset from my phone</li>
<li>Waited 10 minutes for the automated system to call me back</li>
<li>The network was working when the call came in</li>
<li>Automated system hung up</li>
<li>2 minutes later the network disconnected again</li>
<li>Feels like they are doing it on purpose because they want more money</li>
</ul>
<p>6:53pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling technical support again</li>
<li>I think the hold music was design to annoy people so they won’t call</li>
<li>Tanya answered</li>
<li>Asked her to look at my account notes.</li>
<li>Told her about my intermittent connectivity issues.</li>
<li>She informed me that after all the troubleshooting I’ve done the next step would be to sent out a tech.</li>
<li>She said if the tech finds that its a problem with my modem there will be a charge. If its an issue with Comcast, then no charge.</li>
<li>After thinking it over I decided to go ahead an schedule a tech to come out.</li>
<li>Decided to buy a new modem just in case there was a problem with my existing modem.</li>
<li>scheduled for Saturday 09/07 between 3:00pm and 5:00pm.</li>
<li>Don’t want Comcast to nit pick and find any issue with my equipment.</li>
<li>Bought a brand new Netgear Modem CM1000 Docsis 3.1. Still has that new modem smell.</li>
</ul>
<p>7:30pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Called technical support again</li>
<li>Spoke with Valerie. She was nice, smart, and professional.</li>
<li>Explained my intermittent connectivity issues.</li>
<li>Asked her to remove the Arris SB6121 Surfboard Modem from my account.</li>
<li>Replaced it with my new Netgear modem. Gave her the serial number and mac address.</li>
<li>After she set it up it seemed to work perfectly.</li>
<li>It was bittersweet. I was happy the internet was finally working. But wondered what went wrong with my old networking equipment.</li>
<li>Even thought the Internet was working Valerie told me to keep my appointment with the tech just in case. (I should have listened)</li>
<li>She said she would call me at sometime after Noon to check on my connection. To see if I still wanted the technician to come out.</li>
<li>I stayed up until 3:00am catching up on Twitch.tv videos and working on some projects I’d been unable to access while offline.</li>
<li>My connection seemed to be fixed. So before going to bed I went to the My Account app on my Android phone and canceled the tech appointment.</li>
<li>Because I didn’t want to get woken up and risk getting an extra charge.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="September-7th-Saturday"><a href="#September-7th-Saturday" class="headerlink" title="September 7th Saturday"></a>September 7th Saturday</h4><p>9:55am</p>
<ul>
<li>Woke up and found the Internet was still working.</li>
<li>Decided to setup my work laptop to complete some web development tickets.</li>
<li>Replied a few emails while eating breakfast.</li>
<li>Then started working on a CSS issue.</li>
<li>On my desktop I had YouTube open and I had a few videos playing in the background while I worked.</li>
</ul>
<p>11:50am</p>
<ul>
<li>Without warning my Internet disconnected.</li>
<li>The lights on my Netgear Modem were still solid green.</li>
<li>My work laptop and personal desktop both showed me as online.</li>
<li>Checked the website: <a href="http://amionline.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://amionline.net/</a> - it showed I wasn’t online.</li>
<li>Tried connecting to my Netgear modem through the IP address: 192.168.100.1 - failed.</li>
<li>Checked all the cables. I’m the only one here so nothing had moved or come unplugged.</li>
<li>Tried power cycling my modem thinking it might be a minor error. Still offline.</li>
<li>Checked on my Android phone to see if Comcast was having an outage in my area. Nope.</li>
<li>Frustrated, and kicking myself for canceling the technician appointment, I called Comcast again.</li>
<li>Spoke with a friendly tech named Kahlid.</li>
<li>This is his 1st month in technical support. Its been challenging for him.</li>
<li>Unfortunately he got me and my disaster.</li>
<li>At first I assumed he was a seasoned tech. Explaining my issue, using technical terminology, and then I asked him if I could reschedule the tech to come out today?</li>
<li>He seemed nervous and keep referring back to the troubleshooting steps in front of him. Doing one at a time like he was trained to do.</li>
<li>I was frustrated with the situation, not him. He has no idea what I’ve been dealing with. Its not right to take my irritation with the network out on him.</li>
<li>After talking with him for a few minutes I realized I needed to slow down and give him time to catch up.</li>
<li>He went through his checklist and asked me questions none of the other techs asked:<ul>
<li>Desktop or Laptop: Work laptop</li>
<li>Operating System: Windows 7</li>
<li>Browser: Chrome, Firefox, and IE (I’m a web developer. I have to test in all of them.)</li>
<li>Are you wireless or wired: Ethernet wire is directly connected to the Netgear modem.</li>
<li>Do you have a router?: Yes. I disconnected it when I started having trouble.</li>
<li>When did you lose connectivity: 11:50am.</li>
<li>Would you like a technician to come out to your location?: Yes please.</li>
<li>How about tomorrow starting at 1:00pm: Yes. That’s great. Thank you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I talked with him for a little while after he scheduled my appointment. Asked him if he’d heard about <a href="https://www.comptia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CompTIA Certifications</a>? No.</li>
<li>I politely suggested he Google CompTIA and consider getting a few certifications. I told him it would make his job a lot easier.</li>
<li>He thanked me and seemed unsure how to end the conversation. Clearly flustered being unable to help me. So, I let him go.</li>
<li>About 3 minutes after that my internet came back on for a few minutes. Then went off again.</li>
<li>Clearly something is going wrong with the signal I’m getting from Comcast.</li>
<li>I decided to work offline writing CSS code while cloning the hard drive in my Plex Server to an SSD to make it faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>2:30pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Valerie called me back!</li>
<li>She asked me what was going on with my connection and why I canceled the appointment?</li>
<li>I told her my internet was working so well after our call that I thought it was fixed.</li>
<li>Then this morning it stopped completely for about an hour.</li>
<li>I admitted I should have listened to her and kept my appointment.</li>
<li>She told me I was lucky to get a Sunday appointment because the are usually booked.</li>
<li>She ran some tests and saw it go from online to offline to back online while we were talking.</li>
<li>We talked for a little while about stuff and checked it again. It was still offline.</li>
<li>I did the usual power cycle and reset signal routine.</li>
<li>This new Docsis 3.1 modem doesn’t reset like the old ones do.</li>
<li>She reminded me that the techs will be limited to what they are allowed to do because I own the equipment. I understand.</li>
<li>I thanked her for going above and beyond trying to help me. She’s one of the good ones.</li>
<li>After the call I was able to get back into my Netgear modem to check the logs. (MAC address redacted for security)</li>
<li>Looking at the logs below. It seems like the signal is both out of range and too strong.</li>
<li>The error that stuck out to me is “Commanded Power in Excess of 6 dB”.</li>
<li>Quick Google search on my phone found this <a href="https://community.netgear.com/t5/Cable-Modems-Routers/CM1000-RNG-RSP-Issues/td-p/1399592" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forum Post</a> explaining it was software running on a box nearby causing the same intermittent connectivity issues I’ve been experiencing.<br>&nbsp;</li>

<h4 id="September-8th-Sunday"><a href="#September-8th-Sunday" class="headerlink" title="September 8th Sunday"></a>September 8th Sunday</h4><p>1:20pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian arrived.</li>
<li>Went to meet him in the truck. He was distracted and preoccupied while texting on his phone. Made me wait.</li>
<li>When he got out I said Hi and started explaining the issue.</li>
<li>Internet has been going on and off all month.</li>
<li>He asked how many people the sent out so far.</li>
<li>Told him he’s number 3.</li>
<li>Tried to offer more information / assistance.</li>
<li>He said he would start outside and work his way inside.</li>
<li>He went around the building to work on the box.</li>
<li>He was nice and professional but didn’t seem interested in being social.</li>
<li>I came inside and found my connection is on right now. But I don’t trust it.</li>
</ul>
<p>1:35pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet when out completely at. I assume he’s doing something at the box.</li>
</ul>
<p>1:56pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Modem auto-restarted. Connection is working so far.</li>
<li>He came in and asked where the splitter was. I took him to the spot in and told him the previous tech Bill removed the splitter and added a join. Bill said he did this to reduce signal degradation.</li>
<li>Brian said, “Wow, people have been using big words around me all day.” I didn’t say anything in response.</li>
<li>I told him I bought a brand new modem because all the phone techs kept trying to blame my old modem. They seem unhappy that I own my own equiptment.</li>
<li>I said, “I’d rather pay $146.00 now. Instead of $13 a month for 12 months which is $156.00. That way I own it and Comcast doesn’t have access to my home network. He didn’t respond.</li>
<li>He said he replaced the fittings out side. One was burnt from being installed improperly. There was clearly some electrical arcing happening.</li>
<li>He showed me that the coaxial cable has an outer wire mesh with an inner cover and then a center solid copper cable called a stinger.</li>
<li>If the fitting is pressed on incorrectly the mesh touches the stinger and shorts out the signal.</li>
<li>Inside he clipped my wall cables and replaced all the fittings. Even behind my wall plate where my modem is connected.</li>
<li>He said, from what he saw in the box, he didn’t think it was my equipment.</li>
<li>Then he said, if it keeps happening is going to be a break somewhere between the box and further upstream. They might have to come and install a new line to the outside box.</li>
</ul>
<p>2:00pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian left.</li>
<li>I rebooted my modem and router. The internet came back on and seem to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>2:30pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet when out again at</li>
<li>Logged into my modem thinking it might be a firmware issue. Reset my firmware back to factory default. Waited for it to reboot.</li>
<li>Modem came back up. Still offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>2:40pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Called Comcast support and spoke with Joe.</li>
<li>He ran a test and said he’s getting warnings but nothing critical.</li>
<li>Said he noticed my signal is 11dB. It should be between -8dB and 10dB. Clearly something is not right.</li>
<li>He asked me to power cycle my modem and router. Then he sent a reset. Internet came back on.</li>
<li>Because I’ve had so much trouble he setup another tech to come out and check the lines on Wednesday 9/11 between 1:00pm and 3:00pm.</li>
<li>Gave me the normal routine that someone needs to be here. I guess I’ll have to request to work from home at that time.</li>
</ul>
<p>7:45pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Got a call from Comcast. James, a lead, is sending Brian back to check out my connection.</li>
<li>He said he was informed my signal is too high.</li>
<li>I agreed and told him it is 11dB. Joe told me it should be between -8dB and 10dB.</li>
<li>James said the outside box connects to a medal pedestal. He’s going to have Brian replace the fitting at the pedestal.</li>
<li>He’s also going to add a filter to bring that signal down. Hopefully that will fix the issue.</li>
<li>Now I’m waiting for Brian to come back.</li>
</ul>
<p>7:50pm</p>
<ul>
<li>Brian showed up and told me he replaced the fitting at the pedestal.</li>
<li>He said he padded my signal down.</li>
<li>I checked inside my modem. Its 7.4dB now. Much better.</li>
<li>I told him I have another appointment on Wednesday between 1:00pm and 3:00pm.</li>
<li>He said it might be him. He gave me his number and James number just in case.</li>
<li>I thanked him for coming out so late.</li>
<li>He said he was sorry for the trouble but hopes it will work now.</li>
<li>Then he left. </li>
</ul>
