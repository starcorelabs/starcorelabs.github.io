<h2 id="Documentation-for-Comcast-Support"><a href="#Documentation-for-Comcast-Support" class="headerlink" title="Documentation for Comcast Support"></a>Documentation for Comcast Support</h2><p>I wrote this post to track my interactions with Comcast. I only wish I would have thought about doing this sooner.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ve missed a few interactions. But the overall pattern is the same with each call. I’m tired of repeating myself so the next time I have to talk with a tech I’ll give them a link to this post.</p>
<p>Internally they don’t take good notes or talk with each other because most are callous and don’t care.</p>
<p>Also, I want them to know whom they are dealing with. I’m not a typical non-technical customer. They won’t confuse, intimidate, or give me ultimatums. I want the service they advertised on their website.</p>

<h4 id="Side-Notes"><a href="#Side-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Side Notes"></a>Side Notes</h4><ul>
<li>Comcast’s “Performance Starter” says, “Free Self-Install Kit” on their website. Its rated at 25 Mbps down for $20.00 a month. ($30.00 a month for the first 45 days)</li>
<li>But, you have to sign-up for paperless billing and autopay. Otherwise it’s $30.00 a month.</li>
<li>Even though it says “Free Self-Install Kit” I was told I’d have to pay a $70.00 install fee.</li>
<li>Forbes reported Comcast had $86 billion in revenues in 2018, and earnings of over $11 billion. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/12/04/what-are-comcasts-key-revenue-drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/12/04/what-are-comcasts-key-revenue-drivers/</a><br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>With $86 billion in revenue they don’t need that $70.00 install fee. I refuse to pay for something that was advertised as “Free”. Stop being greedy.</p>
<p>All I want is for Comcast to be honest and change the offer on the website. Be upfront that it requires a $50.00 deposit or credit check. Tell me on the website there is a $70.00 install fee. Point out that it is $30.00 a month not $20. Then I won’t complain. I’m sick of being lied to. Just be honest about how badly your trying screw me out of my money so I can decide if it’s worth it or not.</p>

<li>Got a new job and moved to a new apartment.</li>
<li>I wanted basic Internet since I’m spending most of my time at work. There is no point in overpaying for a service I’m only going to use a couple hours a day.</li>
<li>I choose Comcast’s “Performance Starter”. Which says, “Free Self-Install Kit” on their website. Its rated at 25Mbps down for $20.00 a month. But you have to sign-up for paperless billing and autopay. Otherwise it’s $30.00 a month.</li>
<li>Called Comcast to setup Internet. Spoke with Lydia and she said my apartment wasn’t provisioned for Internet. Said it might not be possible for me to get internet.</li>
<li>She said I would have to wait 6 days for a tech to come to my apartment and there would be $70.00 install fee.</li>
<li>She said its because this unit hasn’t had service for the last 6 months.</li>
<li>Had service in my last apartment for 6 years and never heard anything like this before.</li>
<li>Told her I refused to pay any install fee. Because on their website it says, “Free Self-Install Kit”. I asked her why is Comcast offering “Free Self-Install Kit” and then trying to charge me. The cables are already in place. My equipment is already hooked up. What are you installing? I’m not paying $70.00 for someone to connect a wire. That’s a waste of money.</li>
<li>Lydia ignored me and said that they’d have to do a credit check before I would be approved for the service, or I could pay a deposit of $50.00 to avoid it. I pointed out I’d previously had Comcast for 6 years. I turned it off for 30 days because I had to move and was waiting for my new apartment to be available.</li>
<li>She kept trying to confuse me with conflicting numbers and technical terms. I kept refusing to agree to any fees.</li>
<li>Finally she transferred me to Jerome without explaining anything we talked about. I told him I wanted what was advertised on the website. The Performance Starter for $20.00 a month with the “Free Install Kit”. I told him I refused to pay any install fees. He told me I didn’t have a choice. Which infuriated me. I told him I always have a choice. I can use another service or go without the internet completely.</li>
<li>I hung up and went without the internet for a couple of weeks while looking for other options.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-13th-Tuesday"><a href="#August-13th-Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="August 13th Tuesday"></a>August 13th Tuesday</h4><ul>
<li>Eventually I decided to try Comcast again hoping they would honor their online advertising and give me a basic serve at a reasonable rate. Without fraudulent install and service fees being added on.</li>
<li>I got a call from Jeff and talked with him about the situation. He said he could talk with his superior about offering me a “Comcast Gift Card” with $70.00 on it to counteract the install fee.</li>
<li>I asked why not cut out the middleman and just waive the fee?</li>
<li>He said he wasn’t not authorized to do that.</li>
<li>I asked to be transferred to someone who was authorized.</li>
<li>He said a supervisor would call me back in 30 minutes. No one called me back.</li>
<li>I started doing research on Comcast’s business practices.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/Comcast</a> is a forum for all the horrible things Comcast has done to their customers out of greed. It’s a great source for tracking all the lawsuits against Comcast for illegal fees. I especially like all the documentation showing the lawsuit Comcast has lost which sets a precedent. Which I will use to win my own lawsuit if Comcast keep trying to screw me out of $70.00 to connect a wire.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-16th-Friday"><a href="#August-16th-Friday" class="headerlink" title="August 16th Friday"></a>August 16th Friday</h4><ul>
<li>Called Comcast again and spoke with Joel.</li>
<li>He said he could send me the Comcast gift card with $70.00 to cover the install fee.</li>
<li>I told Joel to keep the card and just waive the fee. He said he wasn’t authorized to do that.</li>
<li>I told him I wasn’t happy about the autopay requirement for the service. I said I didn’t want Comcast to have access to my bank account because they have tried to overcharge me in the past.</li>
<li>He suggested using a prepaid card. Which I thought was a good idea.</li>
<li>Frustrated with how much time I’ve wasted on this I told him to schedule a tech to come out and setup my service. But, I wasn’t going to pay the install fee.</li>
<li>He said OK and said someone would come out on the 20th between 10:00 am and 4:00pm.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-20th-Tuesday"><a href="#August-20th-Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="August 20th Tuesday"></a>August 20th Tuesday</h4><ul>
<li>I had asked my manager on Monday the 19th if I could work from home on the 20th to be available for the Comcast tech. He said no problem.</li>
<li>1st Tech “Ross” came at 8:30 am.</li>
<li>He had an attitude and was rude to me in my apartment.</li>
<li>I told him to watch his tone with me.</li>
<li>He was unable to setup the service. He acted like being here was a waste of his time.</li>
<li>He told me it was a wiring issue and he’d have to schedule a wiring team to fix it.</li>
<li>He called Comcast’s technician line and setup an appointment for the next day.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-21st-Wednesday"><a href="#August-21st-Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="August 21st  Wednesday"></a>August 21st  Wednesday</h4><ul>
<li>2nd Tech “Bill” came and setup the wiring.</li>
<li>He said the 1st tech connected the wrong wires together in the box on the outside.</li>
<li>He replaced the wall jack and wiring.</li>
<li>Rewired the splitter to go directly to my jack.</li>
<li>He called Comcast’s technician line to validate the mac address of my modem.</li>
<li>He ran tests and found the service was working OK.</li>
<li>Power cycled the modem and router (CTSSR).</li>
<li>My modem keep resetting over and over.</li>
<li>Bill said it would quit on its own.</li>
<li>An hour after he left the Internet stopped working.</li>
<li>I downloaded the Comcast “My Account” app on my Android phone to send a reset signal to my modem. It worked.</li>
<li>The service was up for an hour and then reset my modem again.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-24th-Saturday"><a href="#August-24th-Saturday" class="headerlink" title="August 24th Saturday"></a>August 24th Saturday</h4><ul>
<li>Got tired of resetting my service every 30 minutes to an hour and called Comcast tech support. Had to fight the automated voice system to get to a live tech.</li>
<li>Spoke with “Joel” who checked my account and found that it was still in a pending status.</li>
<li>He said the system might be sending a reset signal because no one finalized the install. I told him I setup the equipment myself. He said since I did a “self-install” he would waive the install fee.</li>
<li>He changed the status of my account to “Active”.</li>
<li>We power cycled and reset my modem again.</li>
<li>The service seemed to be working better.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-26th-Monday"><a href="#August-26th-Monday" class="headerlink" title="August 26th Monday"></a>August 26th Monday</h4><ul>
<li>After a long day at work I came home to watch a few YouTube videos and write in a post for this blog.</li>
<li>The Internet was out again.</li>
<li>Checked on my phone to see if there were any outages in the area. None.</li>
<li>Power cycled my modem. Then sent a reset signal through the Comcast “My Account” app. It reset and the Internet came back up.</li>
<li>After 30 minutes the internet went out again.</li>
<li>Used the Comcast “My Account” app to do another reset.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes the internet came back and lasted for an hour.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-29th-Thursday"><a href="#August-29th-Thursday" class="headerlink" title="August 29th Thursday"></a>August 29th Thursday</h4><ul>
<li>Was frustrated with having to reset the internet every hour. Called Comcast support to fix the issue.</li>
<li>Spoke with someone in sales who transferred me to an awesome tech who went above and beyond to help me.</li>
<li>She advised me to reset my Modem back to factory default.</li>
<li>It seemed to help and the Internet worked for over 2 hours.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="August-30th-Friday-My-Birthday"><a href="#August-30th-Friday-My-Birthday" class="headerlink" title="August 30th Friday (My Birthday)"></a>August 30th Friday (My Birthday)</h4><ul>
<li>Again I had to power cycle and reset my modem about 10 times.</li>
<li>Spent most of the day fighting with my router.</li>
<li>I removed my router and directly plugged into the modem to see if it would help.</li>
<li>The Internet was connected for 2 hours and then cut off again.</li>
<li>I dreaded calling Comcast Tech Support because they always do the same thing over and over without resolving the issue. (CTSSR)</li>
<li>I put up with the intermittent connectivity because I have other things to do with my time.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="September-2nd-Monday-Labor-Day"><a href="#September-2nd-Monday-Labor-Day" class="headerlink" title="September 2nd Monday (Labor Day)"></a>September 2nd Monday (Labor Day)</h4><ul>
<li>Called Technical Support and fought past the automated voice system.</li>
<li>Spoke with Kate for about 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Explained the intermittent connectivity.</li>
<li>Told her my modem has been reset to factory default.</li>
<li>Explained that I’m on a Desktop computer connected through an Ethernet wire directly to my modem. (Surfboard SB6121)</li>
<li>She ran through the Comcast Tech Standard Routine.</li>
<li>Then tried to get me to agree to having a tech come out to my apartment on Wednesday.</li>
<li>I told her I will agree to a tech coming out but I refuse to agree to any fees or charges.</li>
<li>She ignored me and sent me an email that said “$70.00 install fee”. Which is utter garbage.</li>
<li>I told her I refuse to pay an install fee for something that is already setup. Plus the ad on the website said it was “Free Self-Install”.</li>
<li>She said that she would waive the install fee but kept mumbling about something I couldn’t quite hear.</li>
<li>She told me to click the link in the email and agree to it so she could schedule a tech.</li>
<li>I told her I refuse to agree to anything with a fee or charge.</li>
<li>I asked her to send me another email that, in writing, said that all fees are waived.</li>
<li>She said that once the tech comes out and see that the problem is with Comcast’s service he’ll report back to the office and the fee will be waived. Which will show up on my next bill. In other words, I’ll pay the fee now and then they’ll credit my account later.</li>
<li>I asked her how often does the tech admit that its Comcast’s fault the service isn’t working? She didn’t answer.</li>
<li>I asked to speak with someone who had the power to send me valid documentation stating that I wouldn’t be charged any fees if a tech comes out to check my connection.</li>
<li>She transferred me to someone in the “Customer Solutions” department without telling him anything.</li>
<li>I asked Jerico to read the notes Kate left. They were sparse and didn’t explain anything.</li>
<li>I had to explain everything again. Jerico looked at my account and said, “Sir your location hasn’t had service in the last 6 months”. Frustrated with this same old song and dance I cut him off.</li>
<li>I said, “That doesn’t matter. That’s a bullshit rule the company made up. It’s just a ploy to sucker dumb people into paying more for something you claim on your website is free. Stop with the games. I want the service you advertised on your website. I refuse to pay for an install fee. Just fix it so it stops resetting my modem”.</li>
<li>Jerico tried repeatedly to read from his script and over-explain how it works. Like a robot following his programming. I kept refusing to agree to any fees. Calling bullshit on the “Rules”.</li>
<li>I told him I know he’s just doing his job.</li>
<li>I asked him if someone offered him something for free and then turned around and tried to charge him for it would he accept it?</li>
<li>He didn’t answer my question. Instead said he’s sorry for my frustration and the situation. (I’ve worked in call centers for years. That false sympathy routine doesn’t work on me).</li>
<li>He kept harping on the fact that he had to send someone out and I’d have to agree to the fee before he could do that. I repeatedly refused to agree to any fees.</li>
<li>I asked him to transfer me to a supervisor who can waive the fees and schedule a tech to fix the service.</li>
<li>He happily transferred me to D.J without telling him anything about my situation.</li>
<li>D.J. was quiet and seemed distracted. I’ve worked with techs like him before. They know most people don’t like silence on the phone.</li>
<li>He was paying more attention to something else, probably texting on his phone. It was obvious from his disinterested tone that he didn’t care one way or the other what my problem was or what I said.</li>
<li>He tried to run me through the (CTSSR).</li>
<li>I asked him to wait and listen to my unusual situation first.</li>
<li>I gave him a brief summary of the intermittent connectivity issues, modem resets, and the runaround I’ve been getting from techs.</li>
<li>He waited quietly and then said he had to run me through the Comcast Tech Support Standard Routine.</li>
<li>After that he said the service looks good without errors on his end.</li>
<li>He said if I had more intermittent connectivity issues they would have to send out a tech and charge me. Because it was most likely my modem causing the issue. (Business as Usual)</li>
<li>Then he went silent. As if the silence would bother me. I assume he was texting someone.</li>
<li>I ask him to name 3 brands of modems that are Comcast compatible. After a minute he replied:<ul>
<li>Netgear c700</li>
<li>Cisco T1682G</li>
<li>Anything from Bestbuy that is Docsis 3.0 should be Comcast compatible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I told him I would rather spend $70.00 on a new Modem I own than pay an install fee.</li>
<li>Knowing the answer to be “YES”. I asked him if I got a new modem would I need to call in and provide the Mac address to have it provisioned. He said, “NO. Either he lied to me, he doesn’t know what he’s doing, or he doesn’t care.</li>
<li>More silence. Then he said he could schedule a tech to come out.</li>
<li>I ask if he could waive the install fee. He said no. More silence.</li>
<li>I asked if I could speak with a supervisor (this is the 3rd time I’ve asked for as supervisor in the last hour.)<br>He said I would have to wait 20 minutes for one to call me back. It was 9:30pm.</li>
<li>I told him I would call back at a later time.</li>
<li>He said OK and hung up.</li>
<li>20 minutes later my internet reset again.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m tired and going to bed. I’ll keep updating this specific post with new interactions as they happen.</p>
