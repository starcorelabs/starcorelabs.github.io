<p>Disclaimer: I enjoy writing but it is not my profession. If you want to be a professional blogger I highly recommend reading books on writing, taking courses on writing, or hiring a professional writer to mentor you. The following are suggestions I’ve read from professional writers who blog for a living.</p>
<p><small>[Note: If you write for yourself because you enjoy it, like I do, then none of these suggestions apply to you. Keep doing what works for you.]</small></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide Value - Your number one goal with every post you write should be to provide value to your reader. Write with the reader in mind. As if you’re talking one-on-one with a good friend.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know the purpose of your blog - Are you providing information, teaching with “How-To” articles, or selling something. Maybe its a combination of all three. Knowing the purpose of your blog will help you write individual posts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All posts can be loosely organized into three categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Informational - Telling a story</li>
<li>Educational - Explaining how to do something</li>
<li>Sales - Explains a product and/or service and where to buy it. Always ends with a call to action. Either to sign-up for a newsletter or to “buy now”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Know your audience - This includes age, gender, education, profession, technical knowledge, and interest level in the topic you’re writing about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different demographics are drawn to different writing styles. The majority of women won’t read about men’s health. Most men won’t read make-up tutorials. Knowing your audience is essential if you want to win followers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clarify Your Tone - This is the style of writing you’ll use for each post. It could be serious, humorous, inquisitive, or mysterious. It all depends on the purpose of your blog, who your target audience is, and what your goals are. Pick a tone and be consistent across all your posts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Length - This refers to the amount of words used to convey your message. You could write a post that is short and sweet. A mid-range post that is a page or two. Or, an in-depth deep dive on a topic that covers five or more pages. A good rule of thumb is to know your audience’s attention span and leave them wanting more so they will keep coming back to your blog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scheduled Posts - If you’re writing to gain followers and sell products or services then you’ll need to commit to a strict publishing schedule. You’ll want your readers to know when to expect new posts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example you could publish a new post once a week on Monday at 7:00am. Or you could post new material three times a week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. You might even write a backlog of posts on Sunday so new material can be posted everyday of the week. You’ll have to decide how much time you can reasonably invest in writing, editing, and publishing your posts.</p>
<ul>
<li>SEO - Search engine optimization. This means doing keyword research before building your blog and writing your posts. Then adding your chosen keywords and meta tags to each post so they show up at the top of Google’s search.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is essential if you want to monetize a blog or if you’re blogging for a business. You can learn the basics from doing some research on Google and watching a few YouTube videos. Just don’t expect to be at the top of Google’s search results instantly. It will take at least a year of work to learn how to do SEO properly. SEO is a huge complex topic. There are many businesses built around offering SEO services.</p>
<p>For most writers it would be better to hire a freelance SEO person or small SEO company than to waste time trying to do it themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify your Vocabulary - This one is highly dependent on your chosen topic and your audience’s expectations. You do not want to use words your audience doesn’t know. That will turn them off and you’ll lose readers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, If you’re providing dinner recipes keep your vocabulary simple. Using words and phrases your audience will expect and understand. If you’re writing about the latest laptops and targeting a more technical audience then you can include industry terms and technical jargon to explain the specifications of the hardware.</p>
<p>When in doubt remember, simple direct language is more easily understood by a larger percentage of readers. Don’t talk down to your readers but instead meet them at their level. Otherwise you might confuse, overwhelm, or annoy them.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoid these amateur mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Spelling and grammar mistakes. Use writing software that checks these for you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click bait titles - Unless your blog pays you based on views. Click-bait titles are tacky.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fluffy articles that sound good but provide no real value. Or worse, misinformation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clichés are a shortcut for those who lack imagination. Don’t add them to your writing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Purple Prose - This is text that is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery as to break the flow and draw excessive attention to itself. Its usually found in fantasy and science fiction. Again, simple direct language that quickly and clearly gets your message across is the best choice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Confusion - To avoid confusion write your posts with simple step-by-step lists in mind. Any time you must tell a story do it in chronological order. Break large complex topics down into bite sized chunks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, do not assume your readers share your level of knowledge and understanding of a topic. Give them the basics before diving into a topic. This will make it easier for them to follow along.</p>
<ul>
<li>Complaining - Some bloggers (myself included) tend to complain about things we don’t like. It might feel good to vent frustrations. But complaining alone doesn’t provide readers with any value.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you must complain make sure to walk your reader through a problem solving process.</p>
<p>Define the situation, the issue that caused your frustration, your research steps, and then the solution you found to overcome the problem. Otherwise you’re just wasting everyone’s time and no one will read your posts.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Marketing - If your goal is win more followers you’ll need to market your blog. Review other blogs similar to yours that are successful.</p>
<p>Learn how they reach out to their audience by signing up for their email newsletter. Follow them on social media.</p>
<p>Take note of the messages they send out, how often, and the offers they make. Then watch a few marketing tutorials on YouTube. Combined these sources will give you the information needed to start growing your blog. Marketing is another area most writers would be better off outsourcing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary: The key to a well written posts is to always write with your reader in mind. Provide your audience with value.</p>
<p>Remember, if your post doesn’t hook your readers in 30 seconds. They will go back to the search engine and look for something else to read.</p>
