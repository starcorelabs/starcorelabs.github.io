<p>It all started one day when I accepted a job fixing a computer. Our old neighbor needed to reinstall Windows and asked for my help. I agreed to help her reinstall Windows 98. I popped in the audio drivers and found there was a demo of a music program called ACID. I asked if I could borrow her CD to copy the program. She said, “That’s fine”.</p>
<p>When I got the program installed and played the demo song I was hooked. Of course I was stuck with the 12 or so loops included with the demo. Still I jumped in and started creating my own music. Changing the pitch of some tracks and adding multi layers to create different textures.</p>
<p>After writing the bare-bones of the first 4 songs I went to my local Best Buy and bought ACID Music 3.0. It came with tons of loops and demo songs. Plus there was a coupon for a free copy of ACID Techno, which I quickly sent off for.</p>
<p>Armed with a more full featured program and tons of more sounds I dove back into experimenting. I remembering thinking, “Vast sonic worlds have opened up to me. I’ve found a new playground to explore”. I spent hours working on each song. I pulled wave file samples from crazy sources. The voice of Captain Kurt from the original Star Trek came from a small puzzle game demo. There were sound effects and noises I had found on my hard drive all in that now magical format .wav. Since the ACID program looped .wav files I could do anything I wanted with them.</p>
<p>In a couple weeks I had the first 16 track version of this album. I’d already labeled myself Glitch by then. The album didn’t have a title until my second and final revision of the songs. I remember my speakers at the time sucked. So after tweaking all the tracks and doing the best I could with a pair of cheap headphones I burned the album to CD and walked across town to my cousins house. His Dad had a nice large stereo system. I’d pop the CD in and crank it up to listen for editing. I went through about 5 CD’s before I was happy with all the tracks.</p>
<p>Not long after that I bought myself a set of nice computer speakers and higher quality headphones. Unfortunately, the ACID Techno program and its loops didn’t arrive soon enough. This is another way of saying I was impatient to finish this album quickly and move on to my next idea. This first experimental album was really more about learning and exploring my software tools. At the time I didn’t have an Internet connection. It was much later I found free loops online along with other free audio software.</p>

<p>After a week of rest from working on my first album I was eager to start writing again. By this time I had been going to my local library with a stack of floppy disks. I downloaded all the free loops that would fit on my disks. I wore out about 10 floppies that way.</p>
<p>After working on the first two tracks my friend gave me copies of ACID Pro 4 and Sound Forge 4. Of course I had bought Sound Forge 5 three days before he showed up. I used the highest versions of the programs I had at the time. Along with these my friend gave me a copy of Fruity Loops 3.5. That program was so alien to my way of thinking at that time I didn’t realize its full potential. So I used it as a loop creation tool. I imported my loops into Sound Forge for tweaking and used ACID Pro to layout my tracks.</p>
<p>For the most part my writing process on ACID was fairly simple. I would start by stacking 5 to 8 loops creating what I called a groove. Then I would paint the whole block out on the time line. Once it was about 3 minutes long I would go back and delete bits. I shifted the time segments so I could get down into the 16th notes and cut holes in the loops. This gave me a stuttering effect.</p>
<p>Editing loops, changing their pitches and adding effects was a time consuming process. During the writing of this album I took more time and got deeper into how all my different music creation software worked. I used the help menus within the programs and the online forums at my library. Doing this helped me built-up a repertoire of skills. This was the only album that wrote itself. It was the first album I did that had a theme, which was a fun framework to create within.</p>
<p>I worked on this project for about a month. It was so easy to write I could have finished it in two weeks but I was doing other things. On top of my daily life and slowly learning all my different software tools I was also busy creating my own loop library. Some from downloaded sources and others I wrote myself with Fruity Loops and Sound Forge.</p>
<p>While promoting my first album I learned that most of the people from my small town didn’t get it. I decided I was going to write music for myself. As a form of self-expression so I would have something different to listen to than what was available to me at the time.</p>
<p>This was the only album I wrote that combined my twin loves of music and mysticism.</p>

<p>After my second album I was doing a lot of reading. Something I read sparked an idea of what music would be like on the subatomic level. Drawing from my now vast loops collection I started experimenting and writing tracks. Before I knew it I had about 12 tracks. After three rounds of cuts and edits I was left with these nine. At the time I finished this album I had heard it so much from producing it that I stopped liking it. Feeling it was a failure I almost deleted it.</p>
<p>Luckily, I decided to save it and take a break from writing music for a while. During this theme project I tried to keep a consistent sound throughout the whole album. I used more of my own loops with a small mix of downloaded loops. My style started taking shape.</p>
<p>This album pretty much kicked my ass because I had created an idea in my mind of what I wanted. Yet, at the time I was not technically or artistically capable of creating what I heard in my head. After the second round of edits I just went back into my experimental mode. Putting things together and seeing what I could create, instead of aiming for an unreachable goal.</p>
<p>Saving this album was the right thing to do. After coming back from not hearing the tracks for a while, it was surprising hearing these tracks with fresh ears. Going over these now there are a few tracks I ask, “How did I do that?” Overall, its a strong third album.</p>

<p>The Gears of my mind had been awakened by listening to some trance/dance tracks. I wanted something digital, dirty and rhythmic. Since my 3rd album was jazzier I felt it was time to move in new musical directions.</p>
<p>Having fully digested the ACID Techno loops and played with them in ACID Pro, they begged to be turned into tracks. So it was back to my virtual audio experimentation lab. This time I went big and bulky. I stacked 16 or more loops at a time with multiple drum loops for a heavy driving groove.</p>
<p>After the first two tracks were done I realized this was going to be a deep techno groove project. I stepped back and created the cover art. Armed with the visual appeal it was time to flesh out the feel.</p>
<p>Moving deeper into the realms of pulsing trance groove I attempted to create sonic worlds. The waves of sound being so thick you could almost see them. On the inside cover I had another graphic with, “Can you see? While promoting the album to my tiny circle of friends it was clear no one was getting the culture I was creating. I figure either I was dealing with the wrong kinds of people or I was a bit ahead of my time. Either way, I pressed on and finished this album in a month. As my forth album, its the first one where I created my own melodies.</p>
<p><img src="/img/alien-transmission.png" alt="alt text" title="Alien Transmission"></p>

<p>Like most geeks I’ve always enjoyed sci-fi movies and TV shows. While promoting my last album someone asked if aliens listened to music. It made me wonder what a music-centric alien civilization would be like. They might use music and tonal structure as the basis for their whole culture and their technology. I wondered what their language and customs might be like.</p>
<p>I took this line of thinking a bit further and decided that because they write music they are obviously explores. One of their small scout ships picked up one of our satellite signals. Being music based their technology easily decoded the transmission which happened to be a music video. Intrigued by their discovery of an alien race that understands and creates music they quickly decide to come down for a closer look.</p>
<p>While their technology and culture are more advanced than ours their planet doesn’t have lightening storms. Thinking to hide in cloud cover they are stuck by a bolt of lightning and their ship starts going down. They crash land somewhere in the desert. A few die in the crash, but more escape into the wild. Using their cloaking technology and a spare transmitter they camp out in the remote desert and send a subspace distress signal home. This album is the log they made of their experiences with this alien world called Earth.</p>
<p>These are the longest tracks I’ve written. It has more complex beats, more subtle textures and electronic style noises than anything I’ve done. Above all, this is my favorite.</p>

<p>This album was born from frustration and anger. While promoting my 5th album a lot of people, mostly women, kept asking, “Where’s the singing? Clearly they don’t get electronic music. I visited an old friend hoping to find some support for my art. I was rewarded with a condescending tone and a judgmental attitude. During all this time I was listening to a lot of metal and hard industrial music. This influenced the feel of these tracks.</p>
<p>Back in my studio I began writing standard formula songs. Starting with one of the very first songs I’d ever written which was called “Blue”. Taking the song’s basic structure I built a drum and bass layer using my software tools. Then I played a bit of guitar over it. Next I went back and sang over that. The PC I had at the time was giving me fits. This slowed my work down but didnt stop me. Once the track was done I renamed it, “Slipping out of my Skull”.</p>
<p>This set the tone for the whole album. Going for a dark techno Goth rock style, I started writing lyrics and building the songs around the words. As I said this is the most basic song writing formula and leaves little room for randomness. I kept thinking, “Now they can’t say anything about singing. Here’s your damn singing!”</p>
<p>I poured about 2 months of anger and work into this album. It was a very cathartic process. After I finished the album, bunt it to CD and gave it away, people started commenting on how good it was. Most of them loved the second song, “Rejected” which was inspired by a girl I had been dating at the time. She was more interested in getting high than anything else. Eventually, the situation forced her to choose between me and smoking weed. She picked the drug without hesitation. This is yet another reason I dislike drugs. Turning my anger into a song actually did help me see the situation differently. After thinking about it I realized she wasn’t much fun and I was better off without her.</p>
<p>Finally, my computer started to freak out. I think it had a virus or something so I finished the album backed up or thought I had backed up all my files and then reinstalled Windows. After getting things back up and running I realized I had lost all the ACID files for these tracks. This meant I couldn’t go back and edit them or create remixes, which was a thought I had at one time.</p>
<p>I was a bit irritated by the loss but I think it was part of the overall pattern that helped create this album. So far its the only Glitch album I’ve made where I sing and play guitar. Its a good album and most people say its their favorite. It was more of a reaction to things going on in my life than creative exploration.</p>

<p>Here’s my 7th album. After suffering to create my 6th I decided to stop caring if people liked my music and just write what I enjoy. Of course I was deep into meditation at the time which helps give this album a more peaceful feeling. During my experimental phase I started getting feedback from people. Fans I’ve never met would come up to me and tell me they loved my music. I found out there was a small scattered group of people in my town that were passing my CD’s around. One had lost her copy and asked if she could buy another. At the time I was trying to make a little money from my work. However, since she was the only person who had actually requested a CD I just gave it to her for free. It was my first album, which she said she loved.</p>
<p>I mentioned that I had made others and told her I would give her free copies if she’d promote my work. Unfortunately, I lost contact with her when she broke up with her boyfriend and moved back to the city. Hopefully I’ll catch her someday and point her to this page.</p>
<p>By the time I began writing these tracks I had about 5 half-finished experimental tracks. Some morphed into these songs and others were scrapped. I’d also like to mention that a friend of mine had given me a CD full of loops, something he had gotten free with a magazine or sound card, I don’t remember which. Most of the loops were too strange, even by my standards. They were too ambient and hard to use. The few I did like were dropped into Sound Forge and transformed.</p>
<p>The overall theme of this album is a cosmic view of life. With an appreciation for those rare people who helped me with my music in some way. It was my way of saying thank you for sticking with me. It is one of the most delicate and ethereal of all my albums. My favorite track is, “Calm” which I see as the crowning jewel of this project.</p>

<p>This is my 8th Album. Another theme album heavily influenced by the idea of becoming a cyborg. Running off on different back-story ideas I realized that through the combination of meditation and working with computers I had rewired myself. Changing my belief system, thinking patterns and habits I had become a different person. No better or worse, just choosing a different lifestyle than what you can buy at your local Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>During the writing process I focused on creating my own .wav files with Fruity Loops. I kept thinking about a comment a co-worker had made a few years earlier, “Its pre-canned music. You just line up loops. There is really no creativity to it.” That irritated me. I decided that this album would be purely made from my own loops. By the way, the cover art is a photo of me I ran through a Photoshop filter. Its meant to look old school video game-like.</p>
<p>Diving head first into Fruity Loops I discovered how vastly deep it is. The ability to tweak every aspect of a sound, tone or loop gave me the freedom I wanted. Still, I was limited by my technical skill. I was still not capable of writing what I hear in my head. Being impatient to get the project finished I just keep moving forward. As one of my friends once said, “Art is where you mess with something until you like it then you leave it alone.”</p>
<p>I like this album because I can proudly say I created all the loops, drum beats and synths myself. Out of all my albums I kept coming back and tweaking the sound levels, effects, attack, sustain and decay of each tone. After almost a month of daily work I was ready to quit. I hung in there and finished the remaining edits. Like some of my other albums it doesn’t sound anything like I planned. However, I did get close to the video game sound I wanted.</p>

<p>It has been a long time but I’m back with a new album. Recently I stumbled onto the chiptune scene and 8-bit music, which can be found on <a href="http://www.8bitpeoples.com" target="_blank" rel="external">8bitpeoples.com</a>. The amazing work of these talented artists sparked my love for music all over again. Inspired by these sounds, I found myself wanting to write music in my own unique Glitch style. I downloaded a few free programs to try and emulate those old school 8-bit video game sounds.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>TU2 - The Tuareg</li>
<li>Audacity</li>
</ul>
<p>It was only later that I learned most of these chip tune artists hack old NES, Gameboy and old computers to create their symphonies of 8-bit glory. After downloading a gig of 8-bit music I was overwhelmed with musical ideas.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a bit about the concept behind this new album “Tiny Tracks”. It seems like we are all getting too busy these days. Even commercials on TV are getting shorter. Everything is getting smaller so why not music? So I set out to create my own 8-bit style album with each song being no more than 1 minute long. Using those free tools I started experimenting. Its taken me about 3 full days to finish this album. Of course I used Adobe Photoshop to create my cover art. These tracks were rewritten about 2 times each, except for “Wire Fire” which I lucked out and made it work the first time. Overall, this is a good album.</p>
<p>This final version is 5 minutes of emulated 8-bit wonder. So now those of you who say you’re too busy to listen to a full album have no excuses!</p>
